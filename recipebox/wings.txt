Ingredients

    For the Brine
        6 cups water
        1/2 cup kosher salt or (1/3 a cup of table salt)
        1/3 cup sugar (brown is better)
        2 tbsp apple cider vinegar

    For Seasoning
        1/4 cup mayonnaise
        1/4 cup olive oil
        1 teaspoon paprika
        1 teaspoon chili powder (omit to remove heat)
        1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
        1/2 teaspoon onion powder
        salt and pepper to taste

    For Hot Sauce
        6 oz unsalted butter
        1 teaspoon garlic powder
        1 cup hot sauce, like Frank’s or Crystal

Directions

    Brine
        - Heat the water or as much as can fit in your pot.
        - Dissolve salt and sugar.
        - Add vinegar.
        - Cool completely and transfer to a container large enough to fit full
          water amount.
        - Add chicken and cover completely.
        - Refrigerate for about 4 hours.

    Season
        - Remove chicken from brine and pat dry.
        - Mix the oil and mayonnaise well in the bottom of a large bowl. This
          will act as your binding agent.
        - Add the seasonings and mix well.
        - Add the chicken wings into the bowl and toss to cover them well.
        - Place mixture back in the refrigerator for 1-2 hours.

    Cook
        (Air Fryer)
        - Preheat an air fryer to 200°C.
        - Add chicken wings, leaving enough room for air circulation. You may
          need to cook in batches if you have a lot of wings.
        - Cook for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
        - Remove chicken to a heat-safe mixing bowl.

        (Oven)
        - Preheat oven to 190°C.
        - Add wings on baking sheet with space between each wing.
        - Cook for 20 minutes, then flip and cook another 10 minutes.
        - Check internal temperature reaches 74°C.
        - Remove chicken to a heat-safe mixing bowl.

    Dress
        - Melt butter on low heat (do not brown).
        - When fully melted stir in hot sauce and garlic powder. Stir
          thoroughly for about 1 minute until sauce fully establishes.
        - Toss wings with enough sauce to cover them lightly, but no more.
        - Retain extra sauce for up to 1 month in an airtight container in the
          refrigerator.

Troubleshooting

    - Too salty, brine for less time or use less salt in the brine
    - Too hot, omit paprika and chili powder from dry seasonings
