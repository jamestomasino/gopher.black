Red Beans & Rice
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    1 cup rice
    2 cup water
    1 package sausage
    1 onion, chopped
    1 green pepper, chopped
    1 clove garlic, smashed
    2 15oz cans beans, drained
    1 15oz can diced tomatoes, not drained
    1 tsp salt
    1 tsp black pepper
    1 tsp oregano

Directions

    Rice:

    - Heat 2 cups of water to a boil in a pot with a lid.

    - Meanwhile, rinse your rice in a container with a fine seive
      to clean it.

    - When water boils, add rice to container. Add a dash of salt
      and a small amount of butter for flavor. Give the butter 30
      seconds to melt into the water, then stir briefly to mix.
      Close the lid on the pot and lower the heat to the point
      where the rice-water is at a low simmer. Do not remove the
      lid again for 18 minutes (set a timer).

    - When timer ends, remove pot from heat and allow it to sit,
      closed for another 2-3 minutes to settle. Open lid and use
      a large spoon to pour rice into a serving bowl.

    While the rice cooks:

    - Brown sausage for 5 minutes, then add pepper. Cook for
      additional 3 minutes, then add onion & garlic. Cook
      everything until soft (another 2-3 minutes).

    - Pour in beans and tomatoes. Cook additional 20 minutes to
      soak in flavor, stirring regularly. Add seasonings toward
      the end of the cooking time.

    - Pour everything over the rice in the serving bowl and mix
      well.

    - Add extra salt, garlic powder, or red pepper flakes as
      desired to bowls.
