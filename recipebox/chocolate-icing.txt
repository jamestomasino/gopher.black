Chocolate Icing
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    2 tbsp coconut oil melted (can substitute unsalted butter)
    1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder or cacao powder
    2 tbsp maple syrup

Directions

    - Combine oil and cocoa powder in a medium bowl.

    - Mix until smooth and completely combined. Your mixture
      should look like melted chocolate.

    - Add in maple syrup. (Do not add maple syrup until the end.
      The maple syrup will cause the chocolate to seize and will
      thicken the mixture.)

    - Stir until evenly mixed.
