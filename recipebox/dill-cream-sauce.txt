Dill Cream Sauce
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    2 cloves garlic, smashed finely
    1/2 cup chicken stock
    3 tbsp lemon juice
    3 tbsp fresh dill (or 1/2 that dry)
    1/2 tsp spicy brown mustard
    1/2 cup heavy cream
    3 tbsp butter, unsalted
    pinch cayenne pepper
    1/2 tsp salt
    1/2 tsp black pepper

Directions

    - In a saucepan, heat stock to a simmer, add garlic, lemon
      juice and dill and cook for 2-3 minutes.

    - Add mustard and heavy cream while stirring to incorporate
      smoothly.

    - Add butter a bit at a time and stir to mix and thicken. If
      your sauce is still liquidy, let it cook uncovered to
      thicken for 5 min.

    - Add seasonings last and let it all simmer together for
      another 2 minutes to mix the flavors well.

    Can be served warm or chilled.
