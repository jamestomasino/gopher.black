Basic Bread
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    3 cups flour
    1 tbsp yeast
    1 tbsp salt
    1 tbsp honey
    1 1/2 cups warm water
    1 egg (optional)

Directions

    - heat 1 1/2 cups water to near boiling. Add honey and salt
      and stir to dissolve.

    - Use a thermometer and wait for water to cool to 110째F. Add
      yeast. Let yeast settle in water and stir to dissolve. Give
      yeast a minute or two to settle before continuing.

    - Slowly add in the 3 cups of flower, stirring regularly until
      it forms a sticky ball. When all the flour is distributed
      evenly and the consistency is uniform, continue.

    - Dust counter top with more flour then knead dough for 10
      minutes. Roll the dough backwards over itself and press down
      with your palms, forcing the parts together. Then rotate 90
      degrees and do it again.

    - Place kneaded dough in an airtight container with plenty of
      room to grow. Cover and leave in a warm place for 24 hours.

    - The next day, take risen dough out of container and gently
      roll it into a desired shape on a flour dusted surface.
      I cut mine in half and roll them into oblong shapes to sit
      on a French bread pan.

    - Preheat oven to 200째C (~400째F). At bottom of oven add a pan
      with about an inch of water. This will provide steam during
      baking.

    - While the oven preheats, gently brush the surface of the
      dough with either cold water or a well mixed egg. The egg
      wash makes a delicious golden crust.

    - Add dough to oven in appropriate pan or stone for the shape.
      Cook for 20 minutes.

    - After 20 minutes, lower temperature to 150째C and cook
      another 20 minutes.

    - Remove bread from oven and place on a rack to cool for an
      hour or two before serving.
