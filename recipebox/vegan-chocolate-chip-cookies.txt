Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    3/4 teaspoon baking soda
    1/2 teaspoon fine salt
    1 1/4 cups dark chocolate chips
    1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar
    1/2 cup (110 grams) packed light or dark brown sugar
    1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon canola oil
    1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water
    Coarse-grained sea salt, for garnish

Directions

    - In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking
      soda, and salt. Add the chocolate chips to the flour mixture
      and toss to coat.

    - In a separate large bowl, whisk the sugars briskly with the
      canola oil and water until smooth and incorporated, about
      2 minutes. Note: Use fresh, soft light brown sugar. If there
      are clumps, break them up with the back of a spoon or your
      hand before whisking.

    - Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, and then stir
      with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until just combined
      and no flour is visible. Do not overmix.

    - Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least
      12 hours and up to 24 hours. Do not skip this step.

    - Preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Line two rimmed sheet pans with
      parchment paper. Remove dough from the refrigerator and use
      an ice cream scoop or a spoon to portion dough into 2-inch
      mounds. We recommend freezing the balls of dough for 10
      minutes before baking as the cookies will retain their shape
      better while baking.

    - Sprinkle the balls of dough with coarse-grained sea salt (if
      freezing, remove balls of dough from the freezer first), and
      bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are just
      golden. Do not overbake.

    - Let cool completely before serving.
