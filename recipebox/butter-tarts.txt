Butter Tarts (c/o christyotwisty)
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    1.75 cups       all-purpose flour
    1/2 tsp         salt
    1/3 cup         cold unsalted butter, cubed
    1/4 cup         cold lard, cubed
    1               egg yolk
    1 tsp           white vinegar
    1/4 cup         ice water


    FILLING
    3/4 cup         packed light brown sugar
    1/3 cup         white corn syrup
    2 tbsp          maple syrup
    2               eggs
    1/4 cup         unsalted butter, melted
    1 tsp           vanilla
    1 tsp           white vinegar
    1/8 tsp         salt

Directions

1. WHIRL flour and salt in a food processor. Add butter and lard.
   Pulse until coarse crumbs form. Whisk yolk, vinegar and ice
   water in a small bowl. With motor running, pour through feed
   tube while pulsing until just combined. Wrap with plastic wrap
   and press into a disc. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

2. POSITION rack in bottom of oven. Preheat oven to 450F.

3. WHISK sugar, corn syrup, maple syrup, eggs, butter, vanilla,
   vinegar and salt in a bowl until smooth.

4. ROLL out dough on a lightly floured surface to ⅛-in. thickness.
   Cut into 12 rounds using a 4½-in. round cookie cutter,
   re-rolling scraps. Gently press rounds into a 12-cup muffin
   pan. Press sides to adhere. Refrigerate for 20 min. Spoon
   2 tbsp filling into each pastry.

5. BAKE for 8 min. Reduce heat to 400F and open oven slightly for
   10 sec. Bake until filling is puffed and pastry is golden,
   about 7 more min. Let stand on rack for 3 min. Run a small
   knife around the edges of tarts and transfer to rack to cool
   completely.

At our house we sometimes add 1/2 cup raisins after the raisins
rested a half-hour in initially very hot water for 30 minutes, and
incorporate the raisins after Step 3 and before Step 4.

Other variations:

Chocolatey Butter Tarts: Top each tart with 2 tsp coarsely chopped
dark chocolate just before baking.

Boozy Butter Tarts: Stir 1 tbsp whisky into filling just before
pouring into pastry. Top each tart with 1 tsp chopped dried
cranberries.

Pecan Butter Tarts: Top each tart with 1 tsp chopped pecans before
baking.
