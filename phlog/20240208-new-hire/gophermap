iThis week I hired a second guy for my team. The company is now		gopher.black	70
iabout 30 full time employees so it was time to have a second		gopher.black	70
iperson in the tech department. I got really lucky. I've got some		gopher.black	70
ireally awesome guys that help us out with contract work but		gopher.black	70
ithey're happy with that setup. They have full time gigs that leave		gopher.black	70

iup to speed on all the various ins and outs of our architecture		gopher.black	70

iWe last worked together in 2008. Now we're on the team again after		gopher.black	70
