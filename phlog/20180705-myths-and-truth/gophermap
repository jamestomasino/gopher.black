i		gopher.black	70
iJoseph Campbell was fond of saying that all myths are true. His		gopher.black	70
iline of thinking is that the myths we know and that our societies		gopher.black	70
ihave developed are culturally dependant expressions of a universal		gopher.black	70
istory. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn comparative mythology or comparative religion we see the same		gopher.black	70
iaspects echoed across time and space. In his mind there were two		gopher.black	70
ipossible reasons why:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  1. There are similarities in human psychology and physiology		gopher.black	70
i     that lead us to generate the same responses to our		gopher.black	70
i     experiences regardless of culture and climate.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  2. There is a shared truth which all of our myths and symbols		gopher.black	70
i     help us to express. That expression is unique to our culture		gopher.black	70
i     but it speaks to a universal truth which itself is ineffable.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat is a tragically simplified summary, but it should do for my		gopher.black	70
ipurposes as there's only a small point I'd like to make regarding		gopher.black	70
imyths. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Myths are not true, they reveal truth.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen Catholics look at the bible and read the story of creation,		gopher.black	70
ithat story is a myth [0]. It is not literal. It is there to teach		gopher.black	70
ius something about creation in language and stories that make		gopher.black	70
isense to the culture of the time. This reading with a cultural		gopher.black	70
ilens is vital to a Catholic reading of scripture, even the		gopher.black	70
iGospels.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[0] Genesis 1	/bible/Genesis/genesis-1.txt
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the book of Luke [1], there is a passage that should be		gopher.black	70
ifamiliar to even the most lapsed of Christians. It is the story of		gopher.black	70
iMary and Joseph arriving in Bethlehem for the birth of Jesus:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all		gopher.black	70
i  the world should be registered. This was the first registration		gopher.black	70
i  when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be		gopher.black	70
i  registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from		gopher.black	70
i  Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of		gopher.black	70
i  David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house		gopher.black	70
i  and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed,		gopher.black	70
i  who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for		gopher.black	70
i  her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and		gopher.black	70
i  wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger,		gopher.black	70
i  because there was no place for them in the inn. [1]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[1] Luke 2	/bible/Luke/luke-2.txt
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to focus on just two phrases in this paragraph:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  "he was of the house and lineage of David"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  and		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  "laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in		gopher.black	70
i  the inn."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStarting with the first phrase, this is an important note for		gopher.black	70
ia few reasons, biblically. It touches on prophecy fulfillment		gopher.black	70
ibecause it satisfies the messianic idea that the figure will come		gopher.black	70
ifrom the house of David. It is also important because of the		gopher.black	70
ipolitical implications of the house itself. The house of David was		gopher.black	70
ithe most prestigious of the Jewish people, after all. Heading to		gopher.black	70
ithe ancestral home of that people is a big deal in a culture		gopher.black	70
idominated by family value. This is a key point to remember in the		gopher.black	70
istory, too. Mary and Joseph aren't going to some small town in the		gopher.black	70
imiddle of nowhere. They're going to the home of the wealthiest,		gopher.black	70
imost prestigious family. The people of the house of David would be		gopher.black	70
imany. This is not a land of strangers for them.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's also important to remember that for these people at the time		gopher.black	70
ithere is a great emphasis put on the idea of hospitality. Elijah		gopher.black	70
iis going to return, and they must be ready. He may come in the		gopher.black	70
iguise of a beggar to your door. And so, welcoming in the traveler		gopher.black	70
ihas a major role in daily life. It has such a role, that it even		gopher.black	70
iaffected the architecture of first century Palestine.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe typical home at the time was made up of two main rooms. The		gopher.black	70
ifirst was the family's room. It would be raised up off the ground		gopher.black	70
ia few feet and be all open. On one side there would be a ledge		gopher.black	70
ithat drops down to ground level as the room extends into the		gopher.black	70
ianimal enclosure. The animals would stay inside in poor weather or		gopher.black	70
iseasons, and their heat would be shared by the family. On the		gopher.black	70
ifloor by this ledge were impressions in the ground where feed was		gopher.black	70
iplaced: the manger.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe second room was attached, often with a separate entrance. This		gopher.black	70
iwas the guest house or reception room, and it was intended for		gopher.black	70
ivisitors and extended family. We see such a room referenced twice		gopher.black	70
iin the bible by the Greek word kataluma. A kataluma is the room		gopher.black	70
iused by Jesus and his disciples during the last supper. It is also		gopher.black	70
ithe word used in this paragraph and translated as "inn".		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the ancient world there were no hotels. The closest you might		gopher.black	70
ifind was a tent filled with straw mats, called a caravansary. This		gopher.black	70
iword was translated to "inn" during the story of the good		gopher.black	70
iSamaritan. When the man is injured and placed in the inn for care,		gopher.black	70
ithat was a caravansary. In Luke we're talking about a very		gopher.black	70
idifferent thing.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTaken together with our understanding of Jewish culture and the		gopher.black	70
iimportance of the family of David, it is inconceivable to imagine		gopher.black	70
ithe holy family alone in a barn on that first Christmas. The		gopher.black	70
ikataluma was full, so they were instead brought into the family		gopher.black	70
iroom in communion with many others. When the child was born he was		gopher.black	70
iplaced there in the manger where all could see him.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo why do I bring this up? It isn't to criticize those poor		gopher.black	70
iChristmas pageants. It's to talk about the myths.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe story of Jesus birth is not vital to the story of his teaching		gopher.black	70
ior his role within the faith. If Jesus is born in the midst of the		gopher.black	70
imost powerful Jewish family instead of alone in a barn, there's no		gopher.black	70
ifundamental truth being assaulted. In fact, if you spent your		gopher.black	70
ientire life believing one idea vs the other idea, it would have		gopher.black	70
ialmost no bearing on your understanding of Jesus at all. Does that		gopher.black	70
imean it doesn't matter? Does that suggest that a bunch of these		gopher.black	70
istories are filler and don't have an impact on us? Well, no, not		gopher.black	70
iexactly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe stories, the myths, and our comprehension of them are trying		gopher.black	70
ito tell us something, but it's almost never the literal histories.		gopher.black	70
iHere in the story of Christ's birth we are being made to		gopher.black	70
iunderstand his place in the culture of the Jewish people, and his		gopher.black	70
irelationship to the prophets that came before him. In this way we		gopher.black	70
ican understand that he is legitimate. His role is appropriate.		gopher.black	70
iHe's not just some guy who found a bunch of metal plates in his		gopher.black	70
ibackyard [2].		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iEach myth is meant to communicate something to us that words alone		gopher.black	70
ican't. They are intricately tied to the culture of their creation,		gopher.black	70
iand when that culture changes so must the myths. Without this		gopher.black	70
ichange they become distance, misaligned, and misconstrued. Before		gopher.black	70
iyou know it you are taking words from Leviticus and applying them		gopher.black	70
ito a whole different world.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may		gopher.black	70
i  buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are		gopher.black	70
i  around you. [3]		gopher.black	70

iour understanding of their truth. The myths are not the truth, but		gopher.black	70
ithey are true, all of them. 		gopher.black	70
