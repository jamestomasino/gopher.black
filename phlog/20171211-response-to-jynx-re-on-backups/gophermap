iResponse to jynx re: on backups

iI agree with jynx [0] recent phlog about the awesomeness of gnu
istow. I use it for my dotfiles [1] and you should too!
i
iRegarding git for gopher & html, I'm doing that myself. My gopher
ihole is all in git, and part of my newphlog [2] script
iautomatically adds a commit before doing a pull & push. The one
ibarrier you may run into on SDF is using stow. I was able to get
istow set up on ma.sdf.org, but it is not on the core sdf servers
iand I can't get it to compile. Maybe you'll have better luck than
iI did.
i
iGood luck!
