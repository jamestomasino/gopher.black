 Response to jynx re: on backups

 I agree with jynx [0] recent phlog about the awesomeness of gnu
 stow. I use it for my dotfiles [1] and you should too!
 
 Regarding git for gopher & html, I'm doing that myself. My gopher
 hole is all in git, and part of my newphlog [2] script
 automatically adds a commit before doing a pull & push. The one
 barrier you may run into on SDF is using stow. I was able to get
 stow set up on ma.sdf.org, but it is not on the core sdf servers
 and I can't get it to compile. Maybe you'll have better luck than
 I did.
 
 Good luck!
