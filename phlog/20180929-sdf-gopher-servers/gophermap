iAs many of you are aware, sdf.org recently performed some		gopher.black	70
iupgrading which somehow disrupted their gopher servers. As		gopher.black	70
ia result, everything reverted to being run off bucktooth instead		gopher.black	70
iof gophernicus. After a bunch of prodding on bboard, sdf.org was		gopher.black	70
ireverted to gophernicus, but a very out-of-date version.		gopher.black	70
iGopher.club, the preferred DNS mirror of SDF for gopher according		gopher.black	70
ito its tutorials, is still left using bucktooth.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's a few painful parts to this. A few of the more active		gopher.black	70
igopher users hosting on SDF were actively using the cgi script		gopher.black	70
ifeatures of gophernicus which were not a part of bucktooth's		gopher.black	70
ioffering. As a result, some of their gopher holes failed to load		gopher.black	70
iat all, or loaded incorrectly. Second, the constant changes in		gopher.black	70
iserver info means that our aggregators keep triggering as if		gopher.black	70
ieveryone on SDF posted new content. I know this has been		gopher.black	70
ia challenge for logout [0] whose Bongusta! [1] aggregator has been		gopher.black	70
iaffected. It's also affected my moku-pona listings [2]. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs a result, for the time being I have reverted all SDF		gopher.black	70
igopherholes to using the sdf.org domain instead of gopher.club in		gopher.black	70
imy listings. This way they will display correctly at least. Sadly,		gopher.black	70
igophernicus outputs server information in a footer of gophermaps,		gopher.black	70
iso it will likely continue to trigger the mass-update phenomenon		gopher.black	70
iwhenever NetBSD or gophernicus itself are updated. I think we've		gopher.black	70
iall learned to work around this by now, though.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFinally, I've posted about all this on the sdf.org bboard in		gopher.black	70
ia single requests post. I'm hopeful that seeing it all clearly		gopher.black	70
ioutlined will help the admins update gophernicus to the latest		gopher.black	70
iversion and get gopher.club back in line. Time will tell! If you		gopher.black	70
icontinue to see mass-updates on the aggregators I apologize, but		gopher.black	70
ithere's limited control unless I go through manually to clean		gopher.black	70
ieverything up each time (like logout does). It'll settle down		gopher.black	70
ieventually.		gopher.black	70
