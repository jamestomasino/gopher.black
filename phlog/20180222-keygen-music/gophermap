 Keygen music

 I listened to Solderpunk's awesome new anonradio show, Half Hour
 of Power, which was a fantastic assortment of chiptunes. I had
 forgotten how fun chiptunes can be and I'd also forgotten about
 a similar school of music that I used to be really into, Keygen
 Music!
 
 First, some background for those of you not immediately familiar
 with the concept. When downloading illegal software you often have
 to find a crack or serial number to use it. Most software that
 requires registration uses some mathematical and programatic
 method to validate the serial number that you enter. Fantastically
 brilliant coders will use special software to freeze the operation
 of the program and step through its assembly operations in order
 to discover what these validation mechanisms are. 
 
 If they are amazing enough, they can write a small patch to the
 executable that will bypass or falsely validate a serial number as
 valid. The patch literally rewrites the machine code to "JMP" past
 the validation to a success area in memory. That's a crack!
 
 If the coder is ever more amazing and sly, rather than changing
 the application--like a crack--they'll write their own program
 that can create a valid serial number by working backwards. If
 they can decypher how a program is validated, they can create
 a successful string of data. This is a keygen, and in my opinion
 some of the most sophisticated and beautiful demonstrations of
 code in existence.
 
 I don't know when keygens started adding music to their little
 programs, but the popularity quickly took off. Interestingly, the
 music used for keygens often used the same technologies and
 formats as game chiptunes: MOD, XM, or S3M [0] for example. These
 tracker formats have some amazing, unique sounds and offer quite
 a bit of control for their musicians.
 
 As the years went by, I've saved my favorite tunes, often by
 ripping them from the keygens themselves. I like to think of the
 act of "cracking" a keygen as a kind of computer nerd poetry.
 Also, the music is awesome.
 
 If you want to try out some keygen music for yourself, it's much
 easier these days. There's a great site that archives so much of
 the scene's music [1]. If you want to listen to my personal keygen
 music mix, grab the rar of my archive here [2]
 
 Perhaps I should have made an anonradio show of it myself, but
 I'd rather share it secretly with all you foxy gophers.
