 Tweaks to Burrow
 February 23rd, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I made some updates on my burrow script. It should work for me
 back on cluster again, if I did it right. I decided to stop
 worrying about OSX and that greatly simplified things. Sed on OSX
 is stupid and it makes me sad.
 
 Anywho, lets see if this works!
