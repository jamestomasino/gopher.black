Yurt Life
September 05th, 2017
----------------------------------------


I'm off in the Shenandoah Mountains with the family this week. We're
staying in a yurt! It's a luxury yurt, with AC, full kitchen, king sized
bed, WiFi, the works. My wife isn't into camping so this is as close of an
experience as I was going to get with her. The kid is enjoying it too,
though I hope to get him back country camping in the next few months.

I just paused writing this to close the tent-flap style windows because
a rain storm has started. I love the sound of rain on a tent roof.

I've been overwhelmingly stressed in the last few weeks. My early warning
signs, like my eye twitch and heart palpitations, have been going off like
crazy. I also developed some TMJ symptoms for the first time ever. I woke
up multiple times with ear & jaw pain, and once with a dislocated jaw.
I developed an ear infection at one point and spent a couple weeks on
antibiotics.

The stress isn't work, per se, but that doesn't help. It's a result of
a feeling of helplessness in the world around me. I see injustice, idiocy,
hatred, disaster. I see all these things and I want to take an active role
in fixing it. I want to grab the US leadership and shake them into sanity.
Moreover, I want to get out of this country altogether. I've been working
on that angle for two decades now and it's not quite ready yet. But
I blogged about that in detail already over on my HTML thingy [0].

This week is a disconnection. I'm on SDF doing some phlogging, sure, and
a bit of text-browsing, but generally I'm spending time with the family
and reading trashy fantasy novels. It's good for the soul.

For those of you following along, I did bring my Haskell book. I'll give
some attention to that this week as well. Maybe one day I'll give Papa's
ABC's a shot with it.
