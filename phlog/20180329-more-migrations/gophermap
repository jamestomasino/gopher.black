iI stayed up a little bit late last night and transferred all my		gopher.black	70
idomains off of AWS, then I nuked it. Every trace of me is gone		gopher.black	70
ifrom that platform, and once this horrible bill is paid I'm		gopher.black	70
iclosing the account completely.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the wake of the move I started thinking about where to put all		gopher.black	70
imy stuff and I decided that this little Raspberry Pi is more than		gopher.black	70
isufficient for my needs. I have already gone through the headache		gopher.black	70
iof converting all my web properties to static sites in order to		gopher.black	70
ihost on S3, so putting content into nginx seems like the easy and		gopher.black	70
iobvious next step.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've installed nginx and I'm reading up on how to manage multiple		gopher.black	70
isites with it (seems almost identical to Apache). I'll clone down		gopher.black	70
ithe websites when I get home tonight, port forward 80 and reset my		gopher.black	70
iDNS A records. I've already put together a script for gopher.black		gopher.black	70
ithat handles my dynamic dns changes and updates Namesilo, so I can		gopher.black	70
ieasily package in the rest of my domains there. Finally, I'll want		gopher.black	70
iHTTPS, so I guess it's finally time for me to read the man page on		gopher.black	70
icertbot and start using LetsEncrypt. Whee!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNone of this sounds particularly difficult. Hopefully I won't run		gopher.black	70
iinto any unexpected walls.		gopher.black	70

iMoving away from the technical stuff, dropping AWS also represents		gopher.black	70
ia shedding of a gross skin I've been wearing. I don't like the		gopher.black	70
imonolithic, data-consuming giants. It hurts my heart when		gopher.black	70
iI continue to use them, as I've mentioned before. I acknowledge		gopher.black	70
ithat I'll make choices that compromise my principles due to		gopher.black	70
iconvenience, and that's something I would like to lessen.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDo you think simply pulling websites off AWS can help facilitate		gopher.black	70
ithat sort of change? Am I ready to shut down my Google account? Is		gopher.black	70
ithat even viable as an Android user with Project Fi? I doubt it.		gopher.black	70
iWhat are my realistic alternatives for phone service, anyway? Next		gopher.black	70
iyear I'll have a super-basic eInk phone I can set up on t-mobile,		gopher.black	70
ibut are they any better? Is any phone service any better?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI suspect I have a tiny bit of inertia I can use here but I just		gopher.black	70
idon't see a clear action I can take. A lot of you have done		gopher.black	70
isimilar transitions in the past. Do you have any advice?		gopher.black	70
