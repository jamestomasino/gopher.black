Connections
August 17th, 2017
----------------------------------------

I'm already getting more engagement and feedback from my gopher phlog than
I have in years of blogging on the web. I think it's mostly due to this
community structure on SDF, and it's something I haven't really considered
or given its due.

With my websites I have full control of structure and design and content
and all that jazz. But I live on an island floating in a sea of nonsense.
SEO is a concern. Sharing on social media is important. Driving interest
to my stuff takes center stage. And for what?

Why spend all that time and energy on building my island and getting
people to it when I could join the community and just speak here. I like
the organic connections that are happening here much more. Slugmax wrote
a wonderfully thought out response to my last phlog. Flono emailed me last
week about my gpg explorations.

Who needs aggregators and commenting systems? Who needs HTML or CSS?
Community is a great alternative!

PS:

All that being said, you can find my peronal blog at blog.tomasino.org and
my codey/techy blog at labs.tomasino.org.
