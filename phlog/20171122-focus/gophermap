iFocus
iNovember 22nd, 2017
i----------------------------------------
i
iI recently wrote [0] about a desire to focus my time and energy on
ione thing at a time in an effort to see something to completion.
iI'm addicted to hobbies--that's the nice way of saying I get
idistracted by new things easily.
i
iI'll put that focus to the test over the next two weeks while we
itake a vacation to see family. Rather than bringing a hodgepodge
iof things I settled on two books on Haskell. Learn You a Haskell
ifor Great Good, by Miran Lipovaca, and the O'Reilly book, Real
iWorld Haskell, are sitting next to me and have already been
igetting a good deal of attention. I'll pop on SDF here and there
ito check IRC, phlog, email, etc, but otherwise I'm going to try my
ibest to keep focus.
i
iI'll miss my slide rule, and my spinning wheel, and my Shakuhachi,
iand all the other things I love to play with. They'll be waiting
iat home for their turn next.
