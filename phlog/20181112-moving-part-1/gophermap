iThe next few weeks will be hectic. On Sunday the family begins our		gopher.black	70
itwo week family visitation excursion. We head to Raleigh, North		gopher.black	70
iCarolina first to visit my wife's best friend for a couple days.		gopher.black	70
iThen we head to Charlotte to see her family, my best friend, and		gopher.black	70
ihave a massive Thanksgiving dinner (usually ~50 people). We have		gopher.black	70
ia day or two to recover and hang out with her family then we head		gopher.black	70
ito Myrtle Beach to see my parents. We'll spend a second		gopher.black	70
iThanksgiving dinner with them (and get even fatter) before moving		gopher.black	70
iover to a beach condo for the rest of the week to finally relax.		gopher.black	70

iThe beach condo is great. It's one of my happy places, at least at		gopher.black	70
inight, and this far off-season it's very quiet. Last year I got		gopher.black	70
ia lot of writing done, and I'm hoping for more of the same this		gopher.black	70
itime around. It's also a time to dive deep into my Icelandic		gopher.black	70
istudies and really pound in some hours. It's been going well, but		gopher.black	70
iI wish I could dedicate more time each day.		gopher.black	70

iWhen we return home the house will be mostly packed and		gopher.black	70
idisassembled. We'll crash one night all together in the master		gopher.black	70
ibedroom, and then the movers arrive. Half of our stuff has been		gopher.black	70
itrimmed, sold, given away or donated. Of the remaining things,		gopher.black	70
isome will move to our new apartment and the rest goes into		gopher.black	70
istorage. That storage will eventually go to Iceland in July or		gopher.black	70
iinto long-term storage down in Charlotte. Hopefully we'll be able		gopher.black	70
ito trim a bit before then, though.		gopher.black	70

iOnce we spend a few days moving in and getting settled, we settle		gopher.black	70
ion the sale of the house. With that clear I'll have about a week		gopher.black	70
ibefore the Christmas holiday hits. Flash, bang, New Years!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI did say things are hectic, right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOnce we're clear of the new year the hard-core planning for the		gopher.black	70
iIceland move begins in earnest. I forsee a binder.		gopher.black	70
