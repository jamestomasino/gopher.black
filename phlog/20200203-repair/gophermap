iJan posted recently [0] about the awesomeness of fixing stuff. It		gopher.black	70
iwas timely for me since I've been on a bit of a repair renaissance		gopher.black	70
ihere. 		gopher.black	70

iWhen we moved to Iceland I knew it was going to be problematic		gopher.black	70
ifinding some things, especially specialty parts and quality goods.		gopher.black	70
iIn the midst of that dawning situation I was also staring at my		gopher.black	70
ihobbies filling multiple rooms, offices, the basement and garage.		gopher.black	70
iWe were moving from a very large 5-bedroom home to a cozy		gopher.black	70
iapartment. If I wanted to keep active on a hobby, I thought, then		gopher.black	70
iit should serve a purpose and fit in our space.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI love waterproof, locking, stackable containers. I have a bunch		gopher.black	70
iof the 20 gallon ones that we use in the move and in storage (no		gopher.black	70
iworries about flooding!). I have smaller ones that stack and sit		gopher.black	70
ion an industrial metal shelf beside my office desk. In each of		gopher.black	70
ithese containers is a hobby. That's the space I give them,		gopher.black	70
igenerally. Flutes all fit in one with the music books. All my		gopher.black	70
ielectronics fit in another. All my spinning tools, accessories,		gopher.black	70
iand fiber in a 3rd (the wheel itself is a special exception). Our		gopher.black	70
ihand-tools and sharpening stones fit in a 4th. Everything in its		gopher.black	70
iplace.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI also debated on bringing my 3D printer to Iceland since it		gopher.black	70
iseemed extraneous and extravagant, but later decided it would be		gopher.black	70
iuseful to 3-D print parts that were hard to source in-country.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo now that I've been living with this stuff for 7 months, how is		gopher.black	70
iit working? Well, I've done more sewing by hand here in Iceland		gopher.black	70
ithan I did at home with a machine and a full room dedicated to it.		gopher.black	70
iI'm constantly repairing the kid's clothes, creating stuffed		gopher.black	70
ianimals, toys, sleeves for tools, and so on. I 3D printed sturdy		gopher.black	70
ihandles for our shopping bags since we walk to-and-from the market		gopher.black	70
ia kilometer twice a week. My wife's chromebook's touchpad stopped		gopher.black	70
iworking this week and I opened it all up, cleaned everything,		gopher.black	70
ire-seated leads, and it's like new. I'm even spinning wool		gopher.black	70
iregularly now!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMaintaining things is a joy. Fixing them up and not wasting money		gopher.black	70
ion new things means more freedom from work. We can subsist on		gopher.black	70
ilower incomes and spend more time enjoying life this way. The		gopher.black	70
iworld has less waste. My hobbyist yearnings are itched. Life is		gopher.black	70
igood.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow if I could find a reliable tabletop RPG group, life would be		gopher.black	70
iperfect!		gopher.black	70
