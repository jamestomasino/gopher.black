 What makes gopher special
 March 05th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 First an apology is due to ckeen [0] who I didn't realize was all
 over this gopher thing. He was even kind enough to link to burrow
 in a recent phlog. Thanks to jynx for referencing him so I could
 discover what I was missing.
 
 ckeen recently wrote [1] about what makes gopher special to him.
 He and jynx [2] nail it pretty well when they talk about the
 simplicity, creator/consumer dynamic, and signal to noise ratio.
 I like the intentionality of it all as well. You don't just
 accidentally create a gopher hole. You didn't just click a link to
 oAuth somewhere and start posting nonsense. You chose to create an
 account somewhere that offered a gopher server, or you rolled your
 own. You sat there with the text editor crafting your message.
 It's simple, yes, but it's also much more complicated. 
 
 In a sense, the technology itself and its relatively esoteric and
 retro nature create a sort of gatekeeper. Gatekeeping is generally
 used in a negative conotation these days, but I think this type of
 natural systems gatekeeping is different. It's not prejudiced
 against a people or person for identity, but for intent, will, and
 interest. The technology hurdles aren't that high to say you have
 to be a coder to make it work. Cat [3], for instance, has one of
 the prettiest gopher holes and he does everything by hand using
 the simplest tools. In place of fancy coding proficiency he has
 demonstrated excellent interest and will to build Fax Sex.
 
 I love nerdy communities when they're seething with excitement and
 intention. I hate nerdy communities when they're filled with
 criticism, angst, and envy. Gopher satisifes the first group well
 and avoids the second. Perhaps it is as jynx says, a side effect
 of no comments. Perhaps it's just the community by chance. Maybe
 it's a side effect of the manual execution? You can't do
 a drive-by trolling on gopher, after all. Once you sink in the
 time to get set up, you're part of things.
 
 At the end of the day, I guess it all boils down to content.
 There's a lot of people on here that are doing interesting things.
 Sometimes it's computer related and sometimes not, but that
 exceptional drive to "do" things is contagious and I love it.
