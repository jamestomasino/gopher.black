ijan [0] is working on adding TLS support to his gopher client,		gopher.black	70
incgopher [1]. I am running gopher over tls on cosmic.voyage via		gopher.black	70
iport 7070 [2]. I went to check on it this morning and saw it was		gopher.black	70
igiving me a cert error.		gopher.black	70

iI'm using stunnel4 to handle the TLS stuff, and then configuring		gopher.black	70
ia second copy of gophernicus to serve up the goods. The whole		gopher.black	70
iprocess is outlined in an old phlog here [3]. 		gopher.black	70

ikeys routinely, but stunnel doesn't reload them. It's as easy to		gopher.black	70

iNow I need to think about how to automate that when letsencrypt		gopher.black	70
idoes its business. Hmmm...		gopher.black	70
