iI don't complain about many things in Iceland because, frankly,		gopher.black	70
ithere aren't a whole lot of things to complain about. By almost		gopher.black	70
ievery measure, life here is superior to the United States. In		gopher.black	70
ifact, the thing I'm about to complain about in this phlog is		gopher.black	70
initpicking. The situation in the United States is worse, frankly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat I'm talking about in green power, or carbon neutral power, or		gopher.black	70
isustainable energy, or whatever else you want to call it. You may		gopher.black	70
ibe aware that Iceland's grid is pretty much 100% renewable energy.		gopher.black	70
iPut a period there at the end of that sentence and things feel		gopher.black	70
ipretty damn good. The island has rich resources in terms of		gopher.black	70
ihydroelectric power, geothermal power, and wind. You can read all		gopher.black	70
iabout it on this site [0].		gopher.black	70

iSo what's the problem then? Two things. I'll call one the lesser		gopher.black	70
ievil and the other one the great lie.		gopher.black	70

iThe Lesser Evil		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPower distribution in Iceland is not balanced between individuals		gopher.black	70
iand corporations. The rates are different, their power channels		gopher.black	70
iare different, and their use and the care with which is is taken		gopher.black	70
iis different. In short, companies can get away with some shady		gopher.black	70
istuff. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIs it as bad as the US? Oh hell no. After all, we're not dumping		gopher.black	70
itoxic coal ash into major waterways or anything [1] here. 		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iEven so, there's some ecological impact at stake, and a misuse or		gopher.black	70
iunbalanced use of public resources that favors large capitalist		gopher.black	70
ienterprise without paying back into the local economy. I could go		gopher.black	70
iinto more detail here, but I'm just gonna leave it vague because		gopher.black	70
iI really want to focus on...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Great Lie		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIceland sells its green resources as credits that companies can		gopher.black	70
ipay for to offset their own polluting behavior. If a shitty		gopher.black	70
ipolluter like Duke Energy wants to seem cleaner, they can pay		gopher.black	70
iIceland and claim the renewable energy as their own despite not		gopher.black	70
iusing it. This lowers Iceland's real contribution to the Earth in		gopher.black	70
ia major way, all but removing it as a good from the world because		gopher.black	70
iit allows these other companies to continue their damage while		gopher.black	70
iclaiming to be better.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's a short term gain for a country that was recently in		gopher.black	70
ia financial crisis. What a great way to bring in extra funds for		gopher.black	70
idoing nothing, right? Except it does have a major cost to the		gopher.black	70
iworld as a whole.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIs this worse than what the US is doing? Well, no. The US is		gopher.black	70
iactively polluting and subsidising fossil fuel industries. But		gopher.black	70
ithat doesn't give Iceland a pass. This country has pinned its		gopher.black	70
ireputation in the world as a Green Nation while it makes back-room		gopher.black	70
ideals to sell off the fruits of that labor at the cost of our		gopher.black	70
ifuture. There are many MPs here who are working on this and		gopher.black	70
ia number of other issues. Fundamental to all of these efforts is		gopher.black	70
ithe new constitution that was passed by public referendum years		gopher.black	70
iago but has not been ratified by the al√æingi, our parliament. It's		gopher.black	70
ia powerful document that returns natural resources to the public		gopher.black	70
iand out of the hands of a small number of oligarchs. You can see		gopher.black	70
iwhy it hasn't happened yet right there.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe people all want it. Many MPs want it. It will happen. These		gopher.black	70
ipetty corruptions that take advantage of the fisheries, of the		gopher.black	70
ipower systems, of plundering the Namibian fishing quotas [2], they		gopher.black	70
iwill all be outed. We'll get there.		gopher.black	70
