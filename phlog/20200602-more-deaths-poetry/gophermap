iAnother high school friend died on Saturday. I met her in poetry		gopher.black	70
iclass in my junior year. She sat behind me and we had a lot of		gopher.black	70
ifun. In fact, we had so much fun that we attracted the attention		gopher.black	70
iof another person across the room, Kristin. She came to join us		gopher.black	70
iafter a few weeks in our little area and would eventually become		gopher.black	70
imy best friend.		gopher.black	70

iIn honor of Erin, may she rest in peace, I'm reading back over my		gopher.black	70
ipoetry here on gopher and in old notebooks. So much of it makes me		gopher.black	70
icringe now (I obviously read too much Dickenson & Browning at the		gopher.black	70
itime) but I can still feel the youthful passion. I wish I had some		gopher.black	70
iof her poems around.		gopher.black	70
