 I've secured emulators and ROMs for every Zelda game up to and
 including Twilight Princess. I've got all the manga and the Hyrule
 Historia book. I've also set up a twitch channel [0]. I'm going to
 be playing through the complete series of games over the coming
 months. By the time I'm done I hope to find a Wii & Switch
 emulator to play the newest ones too.
 
 I have no idea what I'm doing on Twitch. I have streamed two or
 three little sessions of Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link, but
 I can't seem to get my headset audio working. I'm sure I'll get
 better at it as I go.
