iI've secured emulators and ROMs for every Zelda game up to and
iincluding Twilight Princess. I've got all the manga and the Hyrule
iHistoria book. I've also set up a twitch channel [0]. I'm going to
ibe playing through the complete series of games over the coming
imonths. By the time I'm done I hope to find a Wii & Switch
iemulator to play the newest ones too.

iI have no idea what I'm doing on Twitch. I have streamed two or
ithree little sessions of Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link, but
iI can't seem to get my headset audio working. I'm sure I'll get
ibetter at it as I go.
