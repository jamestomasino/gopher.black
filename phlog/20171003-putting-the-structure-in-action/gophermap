 Putting the Structure in Action

 Okay, my sed skills are definitely not up to what they once were.
 I tried and tried to find a way to automatically add a space
 before every line until I reached the links at the bottom of the
 page. Did it work? Oh hells, no. I got so friggin close. I could
 use sed to get only the lines I wanted by using pattern ranges,
 and I could make those ranges add a space. I couldn't get that to
 work with the -i parameter, though. It doubled up my content
 instead of changing the lines I wanted changed.
 
 So instead I'm being lazy. I cut the links out, format the doc,
 then append the links back in after.
 
 This whole thing is happening because of Maiki [0] on Mastodon.
 I hope his hugo to gopher solution is a big hit.
