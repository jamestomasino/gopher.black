iOkay, my sed skills are definitely not up to what they once were.
iI tried and tried to find a way to automatically add a space
ibefore every line until I reached the links at the bottom of the
ipage. Did it work? Oh hells, no. I got so friggin close. I could
iuse sed to get only the lines I wanted by using pattern ranges,
iand I could make those ranges add a space. I couldn't get that to
iwork with the -i parameter, though. It doubled up my content
iinstead of changing the lines I wanted changed.
i
iSo instead I'm being lazy. I cut the links out, format the doc,
ithen append the links back in after.

iThis whole thing is happening because of Maiki [0] on Mastodon.
iI hope his hugo to gopher solution is a big hit.
