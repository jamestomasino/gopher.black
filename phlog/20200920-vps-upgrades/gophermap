iYesterday I upgraded gopher.black. Technically I did quite a bit		gopher.black	70
imore than that, but that's probably the most relevant bits for you		gopher.black	70
igopherites. I have a personal Vultr VPS that hosts this gopher		gopher.black	70
ihole as well as most of my personal websites, my weechat IRC		gopher.black	70
iclient, an SMS-to-email relay for my old US-based phone number		gopher.black	70
ithat's now a SIP line, my Calibre library, and a whole bunch of		gopher.black	70
iother nonsense that nobody cares about but me. That was all		gopher.black	70
irunning on a 25GB instance and doing alright, but free space was		gopher.black	70
igetting a little tight.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe upgrade was set in motion by my desire to start a new		gopher.black	70
iTildeRadio show. It's called Sci-Fi Radio and will be airing on		gopher.black	70
iTuesdays and Thursdays at 22:00 UTC. It's a 30-minute program that		gopher.black	70
iplays vintage science fiction radio dramas. Specifically the show		gopher.black	70
iwill start by re-airing all 125 episodes of X Minus One, and NBC		gopher.black	70
iprogram from the 1950s. At the conclusion of those episodes we'll		gopher.black	70
ifollow up with Dimension X, and then some other programs. I do		gopher.black	70
ihope you'll tune in!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, in order to set up this stream I wanted to queue up all		gopher.black	70
ithe content and then automate the playback via a cron job on my		gopher.black	70
iVPS. That necessitated installing liquidsoap and having enough		gopher.black	70
ispace for all the files. Liquidsoap is a bit of a pain in the ass		gopher.black	70
ito get installed properly on Ubuntu. It fails to install the		gopher.black	70
ineeded libraries or puts them in the wrong place. I figured out		gopher.black	70
ia solve for it on my home machine running Ubuntu 20.04, but my VPS		gopher.black	70
iwas still having issues since it was on 18.04. Also, the mp3s for		gopher.black	70
ithe show exceeded my remaining disk space.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, I decided to upgrade my VPS to a bigger plan! The next problem		gopher.black	70
iwas that I didn't have enough remaining disk space to auto-expand		gopher.black	70
ithe volume with a plan increase. Instead I needed to snapshot the		gopher.black	70
iinstance and spin up a brand new server on a new plan. Fine fine		gopher.black	70
ifine... So I did that, but my static IP pointing to the old server		gopher.black	70
iwouldn't release to let me point it at the new one. This may be		gopher.black	70
ibecause I chose to put the new server in Amsterdam instead of		gopher.black	70
iLondon (I still don't trust Brexit). Or maybe it's a Vultr thing		gopher.black	70
iI couldn't figure out. I have no clue.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo here I am, restoring this new box with a new IP which means now		gopher.black	70
iI need to update all my DNS records for the bajillions of domains		gopher.black	70
ithat point here. I logged into NameSilo, which is my preferred		gopher.black	70
iregistrar, and I started the process. I really don't like dealing		gopher.black	70
iwith DNS inside NameSilo, though. For work I typically just point		gopher.black	70
ithe DNS to DigitalOcean for droplets I make there. Why not do the		gopher.black	70
isame thing for Vultr? So I did that! I updated the nameservers for		gopher.black	70
iall those domains and painstakingly set up the DNS on Vultr		gopher.black	70
iinstead.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAbout this time the box came back up and I just had to wait on DNS		gopher.black	70
ipropagation. As that finished I was up to my next step, the		gopher.black	70
iupgrade to 20.04. This VPS was my 5th such upgrade and it went		gopher.black	70
ivery smooth. I had to manually restart one service and then I was		gopher.black	70
ijust fighting a few odds and ends. The "python" binary was still		gopher.black	70
ipointing to python2 which was breaking some things. I blew that		gopher.black	70
iaway and also removed python2 completely from the system because,		gopher.black	70
i"screw that jazz". I manually relinked python to python3 and it		gopher.black	70
iJust Worksâ„¢. UFW didn't like the upgrade and reset all my firewall		gopher.black	70
irules, so I did a little netstat check and enabled the necessary		gopher.black	70
ibits there. And then the last bit of work was going through my		gopher.black	70
inginx config and patching the few services that weren't showing		gopher.black	70
iup, like Calibre-web and my URL shortner service at ino.is. While		gopher.black	70
iI was tinkering I enabled IPv6 for https://tomasino.org because		gopher.black	70
iI noticed it was missing. I should do the same for my other sites,		gopher.black	70
ibut I haven't bothered.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAt this point the only things that aren't up and running are:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- The web interface to my syncthing server on the VPS. Syncthing		gopher.black	70
i  itself is running fine and the data is transmitting fine. I can		gopher.black	70
i  ssh-tunnel into the VPS and see the web interface, but my nginx		gopher.black	70
i  reverse proxy won't work. Blerg.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- My minimal gemini server that was running on tomasino.org. That		gopher.black	70
i  uses ncat, part of the nmap project. When I tried installing		gopher.black	70
i  that on Ubuntu 20.04 it failed. Maybe I'll set up a proper		gopher.black	70
i  gemini server instead, or maybe not. I haven't decided.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh, and once everything was updated I was able to install		gopher.black	70
iliquidsoap and test out my stream for Sci-Fi Radio. It's		gopher.black	70
igood-to-go for the stream on Tuesday! Woo!		gopher.black	70
