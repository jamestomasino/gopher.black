i		gopher.black	70
iIn the mid-aughts I moved to Alaska and took on a role which,		gopher.black	70
iamong other duties, had me overseeing the development of a massive		gopher.black	70
idocumentation project for the state's electronic grant program.		gopher.black	70
iThis documentation project needed to provide content in many		gopher.black	70
iformats including PDFs and HTML. I was a big proponent of the web		gopher.black	70
istandards movement at the time and saw an opportunity to build our		gopher.black	70
icontent with XML and XSLT.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat led me to getting intimately familiar with transformations		gopher.black	70
iand how to style them for various formats. It was pretty darn cool		gopher.black	70
iand pretty powerful. Of course writing documentation directly in		gopher.black	70
iXML has challenges. So I also wrote schemas for the different		gopher.black	70
itypes of documents and set up Oxygen XML Editor with all those		gopher.black	70
igoodies for our copywriters. It worked quite well!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAt that same time I was also blogging a lot and thought to myself,		gopher.black	70
i"Hey, RSS is an XML format. I bet I could just write that and		gopher.black	70
igenerate my whole blog from it."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo I did.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI manually authored one file, the RSS feed, in vim. I used Oxygen		gopher.black	70
ihere and there to validate things and build the XSLTs for the blog		gopher.black	70
ipages, book reviews, and even a commenting system. Later I figured		gopher.black	70
iout how to integrate 3rd party commenting into it and added a tiny		gopher.black	70
iPHP handler to add pagination and links to specific entries. At		gopher.black	70
ithe heart, though, was just the RSS and XSLT.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEventually I moved on from there to some other hot new thing, but		gopher.black	70
iI have always been particularly proud of that. It worked natively		gopher.black	70
iin Internet Explorer at the time and with a tiny helper script in		gopher.black	70
iOpera.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe blog came up in conversation on Mastodon yesterday and on		gopher.black	70
ia whim I looked at the Wayback Machine to see if it was still		gopher.black	70
iaround. Sadly the CSS file wasn't cached there, but the blog		gopher.black	70
iitself and the XSLT were! I'll include a link below in case		gopher.black	70
iyou want to check out the magic sauce.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat sorts of crazy blogging platforms have you home-grown over		gopher.black	70
ithe years? Phlogs and gemlogs are of interest too. I use my		gopher.black	70
i"burrow" utility for gopher. I bet some of you have some pretty		gopher.black	70
ifancy stuff by this point.		gopher.black	70
