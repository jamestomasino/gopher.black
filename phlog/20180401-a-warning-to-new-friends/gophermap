iA warning to new friends	
iApril 01st, 2018	
i----------------------------------------	
i	
iTake a moment to compose yourself and disconnect from  the  moment	
ihappening around you.	
i	
iThink about your place in the world and let your mind slowly  zoom	
iout. Watch that place  become a spec and then  nothing  at  all as	
iyour inward eye moves toward the infinite.	
i	
iNow, with that distance and sense  of  impartiality  consider  for	
ia moment your own actions  to the people around you.  Think  about	
iwhat you consider good and  what leaves a  bitter  taste  in  your	
imouth. Don't linger too long on any one thing, but try not to skip	
iover the shameful parts completely.	
i	
iEveryone you meet today will face that person you  just  examined.	
iThat person:  keep  the  idea  separate  from  yourself  for  now.	
i	
iIf a friend were to  encounter that person today,  what would  you	
iwarn them about before the encounter? How would you guide them  to	
ia better relationship?

iThis was the meditation I did tonight. I thought some of you might	
ilike to try it as well.
