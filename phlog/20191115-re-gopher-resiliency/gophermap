iThe illustrious tfurrows recently wrote [0] on the topic of		gopher.black	70
iresiliency of his gopher content. He brings up a familiar topic		gopher.black	70
iand one tangentially related to the recently popular "right to be		gopher.black	70
iforgotten" vs "archival" debates.		gopher.black	70

iI think I have something to say on the subject, but I started this		gopher.black	70
ireply before I thought everything out. Lets see what comes up as		gopher.black	70
iI goâ€¦		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen I was a boy I had a cabinet in by bedroom. At some point in		gopher.black	70
itime, for Christmas, I got my very own TV that sat on top of it.		gopher.black	70
iInside, at a later Christmas, I was able to add my Nintendo		gopher.black	70
iEntertainment System and a few games. A bit later the cabinet		gopher.black	70
iwould welcome the introduction of some new controllers and my		gopher.black	70
ifirst issue of Nintendo Power Magazine. The magazines grew quickly		gopher.black	70
ifrom one to 10 to 40 until they took up most of the cabinet space.		gopher.black	70
iAt some point or another my subscription ended, though I couldn't		gopher.black	70
isay when or why exactly. I grew up, my interests changed. I was on		gopher.black	70
iBBSes and Prodigy all day instead of trying futilely to beat		gopher.black	70
iBattle Toads. The cabinet door closed one day an didn't open again		gopher.black	70
ifor a very long time.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen it did open, I was older and with wildly different interests.		gopher.black	70
iThe NES still had its charm, so it came out of the cabinet and		gopher.black	70
ijourneyed with me to college and beyond. The magazines, though,		gopher.black	70
istayed on the shelf. Another decade passed and it was time to		gopher.black	70
iempty out the cabinet from my parents' home as they planned their		gopher.black	70
iretirement move. I cracked open the doors and there they were. In		gopher.black	70
ia moment of nostalgia, I flipped through some pages. The air		gopher.black	70
ifilled with a familiar smell that transported me back to a time		gopher.black	70
iwhen these characters, interviews, reviews and comics were vibrant		gopher.black	70
iand new. I was 9 years old again and filled with joy for a moment.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut I wasn't there to take a massive collection of magazines with		gopher.black	70
ime. I was there to empty out the trash, to toss it and let it go.		gopher.black	70
iI put those magazines in an empty box that once held printer		gopher.black	70
ipaper, scribbled a label and tossed in in the car. I wasn't going		gopher.black	70
ito keep them, but I wasn't ready for them to disappear just yet		gopher.black	70
ieither.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe box sat under my desk in my house for another couple years		gopher.black	70
itotally forgotten until a friend's son developed a magical		gopher.black	70
iinfatuation with Mario that can only come with youth. He dressed		gopher.black	70
ias Mario, got every toy Mario imaginable, and even enjoyed playing		gopher.black	70
ithe old games on his dad's emulator. One day the little guy got		gopher.black	70
iquite the surprise when a giant box showed up on his table. He		gopher.black	70
ilooked inside, pulled out a magazine and started flipping through.		gopher.black	70
iHis eyes lit up when he saw that it was filled with Mario and all		gopher.black	70
ithe other familiar characters he loved.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHe couldn't care less about game strategy guides for a system he		gopher.black	70
ididn't have, but he loved the comic stories and the artwork. We		gopher.black	70
igave him some scissors and chopped them up to make new artwork.		gopher.black	70
iHis mom is an elementary school art teacher, so resources were		gopher.black	70
ireadily available. He made some really great stuff from those		gopher.black	70
idusty pages.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis came to mind as I was thinking about resiliency and I wanted		gopher.black	70
ito share even if I couldn't articulate it perfectly. I guess it's		gopher.black	70
iabout the meaning of art in a way. Some argue that an artist (or		gopher.black	70
iwriter) has an intention with their work and that is the value.		gopher.black	70
iTheir intended sharing of an idea or experience is the art. Others		gopher.black	70
isay that the experience of the viewer or reader is what matters.		gopher.black	70
iI think there's enough value for both to be true.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen I write a phlog post or share some experiment on gopher I get		gopher.black	70
isatisfaction from sharing my thoughts or notes or otherwise		gopher.black	70
icontributing to the little quiet space we have carved out. I also		gopher.black	70
iget joy knowing that you all read it. Over the years I've seen		gopher.black	70
ifirst-hand how the things I've shared have landed with some of you		gopher.black	70
iin an unintended way. Maybe they've inspired a response, or		gopher.black	70
ireminded you of a long forgotten hobby. Maybe a silly project		gopher.black	70
iI started and gave up on had a clue to something you were		gopher.black	70
istruggling with. But there's more than the immediate effect.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've run across old gopher content from the 90s detailing		gopher.black	70
iconferences, meet-ups, and stories that are otherwise unknown to		gopher.black	70
ime. I can witness snapshots in time as someone tried to puzzle out		gopher.black	70
ithe future of the internet, not knowing what was about to blow up		gopher.black	70
iaround them. Their goals of communication have little to do with		gopher.black	70
ithe experience I now have in reading. Instead of learning about		gopher.black	70
ipossible futures I get a glimpse of human struggle against the		gopher.black	70
iunknown, teamwork and camaraderie. I get to see the problems of		gopher.black	70
ithe day in a way that's hard from this vantage. I get to remember		gopher.black	70
imy own early internet days and pick out pieces of history. And		gopher.black	70
ithat's just from some gopher history [1]. How much more exciting		gopher.black	70
iis it when I find old code or diaries.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iResiliency conjures up this idea that our writing is somehow		gopher.black	70
ieither indelible or written in disappearing ink. Some people will		gopher.black	70
iassuredly make the choice to nuke their archives and skip out on		gopher.black	70
igopher or the web or whatever. Some will have hardware failures or		gopher.black	70
iplatforms will go away. Others will surely continue to archive.		gopher.black	70
iCameron Kaiser will continue his efforts, or others will rise up		gopher.black	70
iand do the same, and much of this will survive in someone's text		gopher.black	70
iarchives. Others will come and go from places like SDF, leaving		gopher.black	70
ibehind a few postings and files before forgetting their account		gopher.black	70
iexists. tfurrows has four cosmic posts [2] and five more secret		gopher.black	70
igopher postings [3] that link up a really cool and interesting		gopher.black	70
iscience fiction story. If that story doesn't continue then it		gopher.black	70
istill exists as part of the shared universe. It adds to the vibe		gopher.black	70
iand contributes in itself.		gopher.black	70

iPerhaps one day in the distant future our silly thoughts and ideas		gopher.black	70
iwill be gathered together, chopped up, and turned into something		gopher.black	70
inew and unexpected. Maybe we'll all sit in a virtual cabinet for		gopher.black	70
idecades first. Maybe some of it will fade away or be lost, but		gopher.black	70
iI think there's a good chance for resiliency. Our stuff is mostly		gopher.black	70
itext, after all, and that doesn't take up much space.		gopher.black	70
