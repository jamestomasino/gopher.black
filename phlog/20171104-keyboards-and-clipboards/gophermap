 Keyboards and Clipboards
 November 04th, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 Real quick notes tonight. First, there was some chatter on
 Mastodon earlier about terminal emulators leading me to remark how
 I'm still using konsole here on my laptop because I haven't quite
 cracked the nut on xterm clipboards. Well, that's not quite
 accurate anymore. I do have a decent copypasta going now via tmux
 locally using xsel and tmux-yank. It seems promising, so I may
 give xterm a go in the not-so distant future. It performs so much
 better with almost no memory footprint. That could be cool.
 
 Sad thing, though... tmux-yank says I should be able to copy
 & paste over remote terminal sessions if I have xsel on the remote
 and do a few other minor thingies. So far, no luck there. I would
 love to be able to cut & paste to SDF or at least the meta array,
 but that will have to wait. xterm first!
 
 Also, welcome to our happy gopher land to elsa [0]. She wrote
 about using dvorak at work and qwerty at home. I'm a dvorak user
 but didn't do it as smart as elsa. I transfered to this layout
 when I was in religious life and not using a computer for work.
 For that reason, I chose to switch completely all at once. As
 a result, I really can't type in qwerty anymore. She seems to be
 able to swap back and forth (even if it does take a paragraph to
 do it). That's a super-power as far as I'm concerned. I also agree
 that it's short sighted to continue teaching qwerty over dvorak,
 or even colemak. I understand the things that lead to that
 continuation, the things already in motion, but I think they're stupid.
 Learn to type in a way that makes sense and does the least damage.
 
 Rock on, elsa. Looking forward to more phosts!
