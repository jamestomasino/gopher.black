iKeyboards and Clipboards

iReal quick notes tonight. First, there was some chatter on
iMastodon earlier about terminal emulators leading me to remark how
iI'm still using konsole here on my laptop because I haven't quite
icracked the nut on xterm clipboards. Well, that's not quite
iaccurate anymore. I do have a decent copypasta going now via tmux
ilocally using xsel and tmux-yank. It seems promising, so I may
igive xterm a go in the not-so distant future. It performs so much
ibetter with almost no memory footprint. That could be cool.
i
iSad thing, though... tmux-yank says I should be able to copy
i& paste over remote terminal sessions if I have xsel on the remote
iand do a few other minor thingies. So far, no luck there. I would
ilove to be able to cut & paste to SDF or at least the meta array,
ibut that will have to wait. xterm first!
i
iAlso, welcome to our happy gopher land to elsa [0]. She wrote
iabout using dvorak at work and qwerty at home. I'm a dvorak user
ibut didn't do it as smart as elsa. I transfered to this layout
iwhen I was in religious life and not using a computer for work.
iFor that reason, I chose to switch completely all at once. As
ia result, I really can't type in qwerty anymore. She seems to be
iable to swap back and forth (even if it does take a paragraph to
ido it). That's a super-power as far as I'm concerned. I also agree
ithat it's short sighted to continue teaching qwerty over dvorak,
ior even colemak. I understand the things that lead to that
icontinuation, the things already in motion, but I think they're stupid.
iLearn to type in a way that makes sense and does the least damage.
i
iRock on, elsa. Looking forward to more phosts!
