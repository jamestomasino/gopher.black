iCastiglione wrote The Book of the Courtier between 1508 and 1528.		gopher.black	70
iIt's a fantastic read, if you've never tried it before. In the		gopher.black	70
ibook he introduces a newly created word: sprezzatura, defined as -		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  "I have found quite a universal rule which in this matter seems		gopher.black	70
i  to me valid above all other, and in all human affairs whether in		gopher.black	70
i  word or deed: and that is to avoid affectation in every way		gopher.black	70
i  possible as though it were some rough and dangerous reef; and		gopher.black	70
i  (to pronounce a new word perhaps) to practice in all things		gopher.black	70
i  a certain sprezzatura [nonchalance], so as to conceal all art		gopher.black	70
i  and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort		gopher.black	70
i  and almost without any thought about it."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt defined the ultimate goal of the courtiers at the court of		gopher.black	70
iUrbino. Look amazing at everything without trying.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEver since reading the book in high school that has been my		gopher.black	70
ipersonal motto. Even mentioning it "out loud" here in gopher		gopher.black	70
iundermines the effort somewhat. Talking about trying to be awesome		gopher.black	70
iat everything and seem effortless ... you get where I'm going with		gopher.black	70
ithis.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, I wanted to mention it for two reasons:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1) When I was thinking of a show for anonradio, my first idea		gopher.black	70
i   centered around sprezzatura, but I couldn't come up with a way		gopher.black	70
i   to make it a thing without also completely destroying that		gopher.black	70
i   thing. It's tricky! Try it in your head.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2) Some people these days are all too eager to "own" their		gopher.black	70
i   failings. There's a pride in being bad at stuff. It's probably		gopher.black	70
i   a generational thing. Showing vulnerability is cool as shit, or		gopher.black	70
i   something. I'm drunk and an old man when it comes to this		gopher.black	70
i   stuff. I'm of the opinion that if you can be a total badass at		gopher.black	70
i   every fucking thing, then you should be a badass at every		gopher.black	70
i   fucking thing. If you're a badass at 90% of the things, then		gopher.black	70
i   focus and fix that last 10% in the quiet of your bedroom until		gopher.black	70
i   you can be a rockstar there too.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's it. The whole point of this was to tell you all to go be		gopher.black	70
ibadass at everything. Not good at something? Don't tell me about		gopher.black	70
iit. Go fix it. No.. don't fix it, master it. Master the heck out		gopher.black	70
iof that thing and then do it routinely as if it's no big deal.		gopher.black	70
