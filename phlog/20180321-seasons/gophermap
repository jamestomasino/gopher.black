iI have a pet peeve about the seasons and their start date. I've		gopher.black	70
iwritten about this on my web blog [0] before, but the topic		gopher.black	70
ideserves more attention on gopher. Today is March 21st, 2018, and		gopher.black	70
iyesterday was the halfway point of Spring, not the first day.		gopher.black	70

iThe equinoxes and solstices are mid-point measurements of the		gopher.black	70
isolar seasons. The vernal equinox and autumnal equinox are the		gopher.black	70
idates when the day and night are of equal length. This is an		gopher.black	70
iappropriate date to count as halfway between Summer and Winter. It		gopher.black	70
iis an appropriate date to be the mid-point of Spring or Autumn.		gopher.black	70
iIt's logical. It's measurable.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Winter Solstice, the date of the longest night, is an		gopher.black	70
iappropriate marker for the middle of Winter. Again it makes sense.		gopher.black	70
iThe Summer Soltice, the longest day, you know... the thing		gopher.black	70
iliterally called "Mid-Summer" in A Mid-Summer's Night Dream. Do		gopher.black	70

iSo what the hell, why is everyone else on Earth a big dummy		gopher.black	70
idetermined to piss off tomasino? I think they're lazy. The big		gopher.black	70
ifour seasonal days are easy to remember. Who remembers Imbolc or		gopher.black	70
iBeltane or Lammas or Samhain except Wiccans and celtic cosplayers?		gopher.black	70
iIt's easier to just summarize everything down to the four days we		gopher.black	70
iknow and pretend they're the start of the season. We'll give the		gopher.black	70
idecision some extra bull-shit creedence by saying it aligns better		gopher.black	70
iwith a meteorological season (aka, Spring is fucking cold).		gopher.black	70
iI don't buy it, though. We have days for this stuff already and		gopher.black	70
ithey are set for a reason. Stop being lazy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNeed another example while I'm ranting? How about good old		gopher.black	70
iGroundhog's day? Imbolc by another name! February 2nd, Candlemas,		gopher.black	70
ithe first day of Spring. It's still celebrated by an esoteric		gopher.black	70
itradition with no real purpose other than to piss off a sleepy		gopher.black	70
irodent. We literally pull that dude out of his hole and hold him		gopher.black	70
iup to forecast whether we're going to have "6 more weeks of		gopher.black	70
iWinter". Here again we're talking about weather, not seasons. The		gopher.black	70
iseason is over. You just celebrated the first day of Spring		gopher.black	70
iwithout realizing it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAre you following me here? This is not some little nit-picky thing		gopher.black	70
ithat one or two news stations screwed up but a world-wide shift.		gopher.black	70
iIt gets me really peeved!		gopher.black	70

iDo you have something like the Seasons which eats you up inside		gopher.black	70
ithat you need to rant about on gopher? I wanna know about it so		gopher.black	70
iI can join you in righteous anger.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBring it on, and happy mid-spring.		gopher.black	70
