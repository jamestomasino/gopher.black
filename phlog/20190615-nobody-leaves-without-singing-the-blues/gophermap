iWell, tag this post as "meta-gopher" because that's how I feel		gopher.black	70
iabout port 70. The ratio of consumer to creator is remarkably		gopher.black	70
imatched as observed over on lambda lab [1]. We have a significant		gopher.black	70
itechnical barrier to use (for good or ill), but a very low		gopher.black	70
isecondary barrier to contribution. I think of it like a reef that		gopher.black	70
iprotects the cove of port 70. If you know how to navigate into our		gopher.black	70
isafe little space then you already have more than enough skill to		gopher.black	70
ibecome an active part of the community. That's cool.		gopher.black	70
