iI've become self-conscious of my own phlogging on gopher on the	
isubject of gopher, or gopher related things. I do a lot of writing	
iabout the protocol, the community, my scripts for my phlog, other	
ipeople's phlogging, gopher project, you get the idea. I started to	
iworry that I was neglecting original content for its own right	
ithat wasn't all oriented to the weird little place we hang out. As	
ia result, I'm going to try to post more non-gophery things. There	
iwill be no hard and fast rules about numbers or anything, but I'll	
itry.
