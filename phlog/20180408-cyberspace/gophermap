iA few minutes ago in the #gopher irc room on sdf.org, zcrayfish	
ijust mentioned remembering connecting to sdf over old modem	
iprograms (xyzmodem). It brought back a flood of memories. I last	
iremember using zmodem to connect to my friend Kris's new machine.	
iWe connected via blank term sometimes and just typed messages back	
iand forth in the same buffer. When we switched to zmodem I can	
iremember the thrill the first time we successfully resumed a file	
itransfer, not having to start it all over. Brilliant.	
i	
iMostly what stood out to me in memory is that the setting of these	
imemories was virtual. I did not remember sitting at my computer	
iusing zmodem, but as if my place in the world was within zmodem.	
iI embodied it to the fullest extent of existential awareness.	
iI had no body, only idea form.	
i	
iThat makes me think more broadly on that concept. I did not have	
iit before that time when connecting to Prodigy and spending time	
ion the Xanth Chatroom I would eventually moderate. Those memories	
iinvolve seeing my hands typing, and the texture of the monitor.	
iI wasn't "in" the computer then. Ahh, but later, connecting to	
iSnakes Lair BBS in South Jersey, I am there in the door games, in	
ithe discussion boards, in all of it.	
i	
iBBSes are the start of virtual existance for me. That feels pretty	
icool.
