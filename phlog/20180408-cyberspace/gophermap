iA few minutes ago in the #gopher irc room on sdf.org, zcrayfish		gopher.black	70
ijust mentioned remembering connecting to sdf over old modem		gopher.black	70
iprograms (xyzmodem). It brought back a flood of memories. I last		gopher.black	70
iremember using zmodem to connect to my friend Kris's new machine.		gopher.black	70
iWe connected via blank term sometimes and just typed messages back		gopher.black	70
iand forth in the same buffer. When we switched to zmodem I can		gopher.black	70
iremember the thrill the first time we successfully resumed a file		gopher.black	70
itransfer, not having to start it all over. Brilliant.		gopher.black	70

iMostly what stood out to me in memory is that the setting of these		gopher.black	70
imemories was virtual. I did not remember sitting at my computer		gopher.black	70
iusing zmodem, but as if my place in the world was within zmodem.		gopher.black	70
iI embodied it to the fullest extent of existential awareness.		gopher.black	70
iI had no body, only idea form.		gopher.black	70

iThat makes me think more broadly on that concept. I did not have		gopher.black	70
iit before that time when connecting to Prodigy and spending time		gopher.black	70
ion the Xanth Chatroom I would eventually moderate. Those memories		gopher.black	70
iinvolve seeing my hands typing, and the texture of the monitor.		gopher.black	70
iI wasn't "in" the computer then. Ahh, but later, connecting to		gopher.black	70
iSnakes Lair BBS in South Jersey, I am there in the door games, in		gopher.black	70
ithe discussion boards, in all of it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBBSes are the start of virtual existance for me. That feels pretty		gopher.black	70
icool.		gopher.black	70
