iThis phlog is about web stuff. Specifically it's about Indyweb		gopher.black	70
ithings and microformats.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI use my website https://tomasino.org as an IndieAuth [0] portal.		gopher.black	70
iWhen logging into sites that understand the IndieWeb concept,		gopher.black	70
iI provide my "Home" URL as an identifier. Then the site scrubs		gopher.black	70
ithrough all the various links I have on that page and picks out		gopher.black	70
ithose that it can understand for authentication. In most cases		gopher.black	70
iI get GPG and GitHub hits, though occasionally a site will support		gopher.black	70
imore. I oAuth in, and bam... identified. It's pretty neat and		gopher.black	70
irequires very little effort on my side.		gopher.black	70

h[0] IndieAuth	URL:https://indieauth.com/
i		gopher.black	70
iThere are much fancier IndieWeb doodads though, and I wanted to		gopher.black	70
istart taking advantage of some. In particular Webmentions had		gopher.black	70
idrawn my attention. It's a different way to handle commenting		gopher.black	70
ithat, honestly, reminds me of what we do here in gopherspace.		gopher.black	70
iInstead of leaving a comment on a post somewhere, you just write		gopher.black	70
iyour own blog post and "notify" the original. The original page		gopher.black	70
ican then choose whether to add a link to yours or ignore it or		gopher.black	70
iwhatever. Everyone maintains control of their own words and all is		gopher.black	70
iwell!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo I opened up the IndieWeb sites and went digging into		gopher.black	70
iWebmentions [1]. I was immediately reminded why I abandonded this		gopher.black	70
ithe last time around. While the concept is incredibly simple, the		gopher.black	70
iimplementation is annoyingly complex and the terminology for		gopher.black	70
ithings is as bad as git [2].		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iSince my sites are all static I wasn't looking for a plugin or		gopher.black	70
ieven something that automatically displayed anything on the		gopher.black	70
ifront-end at all. I just wanted something to process webmentions		gopher.black	70
iand give me a way to see that they happened. For my low traffic		gopher.black	70
isites, a Webmention-to-Email system would have been perfect.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere are a number of things out there already. Some support the		gopher.black	70
iWebmention client role and others the server because--did I not		gopher.black	70
imention this?--you need webmentions set up on both sides for it to		gopher.black	70
iwork. So to actually do it you need reading, writing, discovery		gopher.black	70
iand parsing. There are a handful of projects doing the various		gopher.black	70
ipoints and most of them are "in development" to varying degrees.		gopher.black	70
iAlmost all of them have complex esoteric documentation that only		gopher.black	70
imakes sense if you're already familiar with the protocol enough to		gopher.black	70
iwrite your own software. Lovely!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere are a few 3rd party services that offer the basics without		gopher.black	70
icharge. I don't know if they work or not, but that's what I ended		gopher.black	70
iup trying. I really don't want to spend the whole Christmas break		gopher.black	70
ifiguring this stuff out. I don't expect to get many, if any,		gopher.black	70
imentions anyway. Webmention.io is the service I went with. I used		gopher.black	70
iIndieAuth to log in and then grabbed the links it gave me to paste		gopher.black	70
ion my various blogs. I have no idea how to "use" Webmentions from		gopher.black	70
ithe other side, and no idea how to test if I'm set up correctly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI wonder if I need to IndieAuth with the blog URL itself and then		gopher.black	70
iuse webmention.io directly to that property only and then repeat		gopher.black	70
ithe process for the other site. It says I should be able to use it		gopher.black	70
ion many sites though, so hopefully it's fine. Time will tell.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWebmention.io provides a microformat feed of the mentions you		gopher.black	70
ireceive. I was going to grab the RSS one and plug it into my RSS		gopher.black	70
ireader until I noticed the mention of this other IndieWeb format,		gopher.black	70
iMicrosub.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh joy! Another one. :D		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMicrosub seems like an abstraction layer above microformats that		gopher.black	70
ican be interpretted as feeds or notifications. RSS and Atom are		gopher.black	70
ivalid inputs, but so are other bits. Like other IndieWeb things,		gopher.black	70
ithere's a big push to separate client & servers. In this case		gopher.black	70
iI found Aperture [3] as a server and I'm using a couple different		gopher.black	70
iclients to see the front-end.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[3] Aperture	URL:https://aperture.p3k.io/
i		gopher.black	70
iMost of these projects are also "in development", but they seem		gopher.black	70
ifunctional enough that I was able to dupe my tt-rss contents over.		gopher.black	70
iAs I mentioned in my last post [4], I'm looking for a replacement		gopher.black	70
ifor that software anyway so maybe this will work out.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iEventually I'd like to run all these services myself (though		gopher.black	70
iI have no desire to write the software to do so myself). I have		gopher.black	70
inginx running on this webserver already so if I can dockerize the		gopher.black	70
ibits & pieces together into an IndieWeb multi-container and		gopher.black	70
ireverse proxy everything that would be perfect. For now I'm		gopher.black	70
iputting a pin in it. Things are good enough.		gopher.black	70

iAre any of you running IndieWeb goodness? Have thoughts or		gopher.black	70
isuggestions? Wanna vent? Send me a mention in the lovely gopher		gopher.black	70
