iMirroring on SDF

iThings from gopher.black should be mirroring properly on SDF now.	
iI've written a script to pull the phlog regularly and update	
ithings. It checks the timestamp of my main gophermap before and	
iafter pulling. If the timestamp changed, something is new... and	
iit touches the gopher folder to update my placement on the phlog	
ilists. Lets see how this goes!	
i	
iHere's my script, in case anyone wants to duplicate the effort.	
iNote that 'stat' on cluster is not GNU stat and has a wildly	
idifferent format. Yeesh.	
i	
i  #!/usr/bin/env bash	
i  	
i  # Config	
i  GOPHER_DIR="/ftp/pub/users/tomasino/"	
i  GOPHERMAP="${GOPHER_DIR}/gophermap"	
i  	
i  # Overrides	
i  pushd () {	
i    command pushd "$@" > /dev/null	
i  }	
i  	
i  popd () {	
i    command popd "$@" > /dev/null	
i  }	
i  	
i  # Grab timestamp of gophermap before pulling	
i  gophermap_start_time=$(stat -Lnqr "${GOPHERMAP}" | awk '{print $9}' )	
i  	
i  # Pull the latest content silently	
i  pushd "${GOPHER_DIR}"	
i  git pull -q origin master	
i  popd	
i  	
i  # Grab timestamp of gophermap after pulling	
i  gophermap_end_time=$(stat -Lnqr "${GOPHERMAP}" | awk '{print $9}' )	
i  	
i  # If the timestamps are different, touch the folder to trigger phlog listing	
i  if [[ "${gophermap_start_time}" != "${gophermap_end_time}" ]]; then	
i    touch "${GOPHER_DIR}"	
i  fi
