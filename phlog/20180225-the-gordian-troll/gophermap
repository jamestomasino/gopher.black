iThe Gordian Troll
iFebruary 25th, 2018
i----------------------------------------
i
iA quick observation:
i
iMore sophisticated, technical, complex, or nuanced topics will
iface proportionally increased conflict and criticism.
i
iHop on YouTube and click on a concert pianist playing a masterful
irendition of one of the most technically difficult works of music
iand the comment thread will read with the same vitriolic pedantry
iyou'll find discussing quantum vulnerabilities in cryptographic
isystems. Discuss the specific statistical merits and deficiencies
iin a local sports team and the same trolls will rear their heads.
iShockingly, you may even be one of them without realizing it, if
ithe topic of specialization falls into your wheelhouse. I'm
isusceptible as well.
i
iIn comparison, think onto topics without complexity and watch the
ibar for success rise. An unattractive woman passably sings a well
iknown Broadway number in a contest and the crowd goes wild. The
ipop stardom of virtually everyone.
i
iI call it the Gordian Troll effect.
i
iAm I experiencing a bias which has blinded me to reality, or does
iany of this sound familiar to you?
