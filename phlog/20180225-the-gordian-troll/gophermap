 The Gordian Troll
 February 25th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 A quick observation:
 
 More sophisticated, technical, complex, or nuanced topics will
 face proportionally increased conflict and criticism.
 
 Hop on YouTube and click on a concert pianist playing a masterful
 rendition of one of the most technically difficult works of music
 and the comment thread will read with the same vitriolic pedantry
 you'll find discussing quantum vulnerabilities in cryptographic
 systems. Discuss the specific statistical merits and deficiencies
 in a local sports team and the same trolls will rear their heads.
 Shockingly, you may even be one of them without realizing it, if
 the topic of specialization falls into your wheelhouse. I'm
 susceptible as well.
 
 In comparison, think onto topics without complexity and watch the
 bar for success rise. An unattractive woman passably sings a well
 known Broadway number in a contest and the crowd goes wild. The
 pop stardom of virtually everyone.
 
 I call it the Gordian Troll effect.
 
 Am I experiencing a bias which has blinded me to reality, or does
 any of this sound familiar to you?
