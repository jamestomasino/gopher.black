ichristyotwisty [0] asked a question on Mastodon tonight:		gopher.black	70
1[0] christyotwisty	/users/christyotwisty	sdf.org	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Those who use #magick to #manifest a material desire: what is it		gopher.black	70
i  about the manifestation that tells you it's magick and not		gopher.black	70
i  Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's a lot to unpack in her request and I want to do it		gopher.black	70
ijustice, hence why the answer is happening here on gopher rather		gopher.black	70
ithan in a 500 character toot. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to proceed logically. Taking to heart what Voltaire said,		gopher.black	70
i"If you want to converse with me, first define your terms," I'll		gopher.black	70
iattempt to do that now.		gopher.black	70

i          ---------- Defining Terms ---------- 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[1] Magick	/Magick (Thelema)	gopherpedia.com	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe addition of the k to the end of magic has long been credited		gopher.black	70
ito Aleister Crowley's Thelema to differentiate the occult practice		gopher.black	70
ifrom stage magic and illusion. Since he coined the term I'll use		gopher.black	70
ihis definition here: "the Science and Art of causing Change to		gopher.black	70
ioccur in conformity with Will".		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHis definition was quite loose, and if you read his works you'll		gopher.black	70
isee he uses the term interchangably to describe mundane acts, such		gopher.black	70
ias like reaching out and picking up a pencil, along side ritual		gopher.black	70
imagic which normally springs to mind. The idea that will can cause		gopher.black	70
iany change in an object that it would be normally capable of in		gopher.black	70
inature is not surprising, then. With the right effort, anything		gopher.black	70
ican be achieved. This line of thinking conflates and contrasts the		gopher.black	70
iconcepts of free will with destiny and leads to some... creative		gopher.black	70
iconclusions.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFor the purposes of this post I'm going to narrow Crowley's focus		gopher.black	70
iinto just his later category of occult action of will to affect		gopher.black	70
ichange. I suspect this is where christyotwisty was going with her		gopher.black	70
iquestion. As we proceed I'll try to further narrow this definition		gopher.black	70
iand cross-reference it with other, similar concepts.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFrequency illusion		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs defined on Wikipedia's list of cognative biases: "The illusion		gopher.black	70
iin which a word, a name, or other thing that has recently come to		gopher.black	70
ione's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency		gopher.black	70
ishortly afterwards (not to be confused with the recency illusion		gopher.black	70
ior selection bias). This illusion is sometimes referred to as the		gopher.black	70
iBaader-Meinhof phenomenon."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn addition to this specific illusion bias, I'll also try to		gopher.black	70
iaddress synchronicity and confirmation bias. There's really a host		gopher.black	70
iof mental phenomena which are all interrelated in the context of		gopher.black	70
ithe question.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i       ---------- Subject-matter clarification  ----------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBefore addressing the question directly I think I should say		gopher.black	70
ia word or two about the subject of magick itself. There is		gopher.black	70
ia strong divide between groups of people who entertain the idea of		gopher.black	70
imagick as a serious phenomenon and those who dismiss it as		gopher.black	70
ichildish delusion. All too often, the former group is then		gopher.black	70
istigmatized and preconceived prejudices run wild, which		gopher.black	70
iunfortunately make serious discussion all but impossible.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to disuade that behavior by stretching the concept of		gopher.black	70
imagick to include similar practices that fall under more widely		gopher.black	70
iacceptable terminology. Remembering our core definition of		gopher.black	70
imagick--the use of will via occult (or paranormal) means to affect		gopher.black	70
ichange--we can find many common practices that fit the mold.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iThe entire system of Chinese medicine falls into this category,		gopher.black	70
imanipulating unseen energies through will and the use of natural		gopher.black	70
iactions, herbs, and meditation. Falun Gong, Prana, Tao Yin and so		gopher.black	70
ion also fit.		gopher.black	70

iIn the west there are many religious practices deeply rooted in		gopher.black	70
iChristianity which clearly fit the definition of magick we're		gopher.black	70
iusing. Between the extremes of popular religious rites and the		gopher.black	70
iridiculed parlor ritual there is a whole range of activity. Yoga,		gopher.black	70
ireiki, mindfullness medititation, and good old basic prayer all		gopher.black	70
iseek to affect some sort of change through the focus of primarily		gopher.black	70
imental expressions of will.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs you can see, the question here is not limited to casting spells		gopher.black	70
iin a circle under a full moon. You could reasonably reword		gopher.black	70
ichristyotwisty's question:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Those who pray for change: what tells you it's working and not		gopher.black	70
i  just your mind playing a trick on you?		gopher.black	70

i         ---------- Efficacy of Magick ---------- 		gopher.black	70

0[7] Efficacy of Prayer	/Efficacy of prayer	gopherpedia.com	70
i		gopher.black	70
iUsing the framework we've established, we can use the more		gopher.black	70
imainstream magickal practices to explore the scientific		gopher.black	70
iinvestigations of occult phenomena. In the link above, there is		gopher.black	70
ia wealth of information about the difficulties in statistical		gopher.black	70
iinference and falsifiablity, measurability in general, and		gopher.black	70
ia survey of the types of studies that have been done. I'd strongly		gopher.black	70
irecommend reading that page cover-to-cover with an open mind.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe most striking thing to me about the challenges of study and		gopher.black	70
ithe measurability of outcomes is that we must take a sacred		gopher.black	70
iactivity and measure it by elements that are profane (to use the		gopher.black	70
iterms of Mircea Elliade). Ultimately the change that should occur		gopher.black	70
iis a profane one, though. It must be concerned with the material		gopher.black	70
iworld or else we're using our mind to change our mind, which		gopher.black	70
idoesn't seem to fit our narrow definition of magick. Perhaps using		gopher.black	70
iyour mind to change the mind of another could fit, but the method		gopher.black	70
iwould be the key deliniation (batting your eyes and winking can		gopher.black	70
icertainly create new thoughts in someone else but is that		gopher.black	70
imagick?).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf our outcomes are limited to the physical then they are		gopher.black	70
imeasurable. What comes next is to determine what action of will		gopher.black	70
ican create these effects at a significant rate above a control.		gopher.black	70
iThis is a very rigorous way to avoid issues of the Baader-Meinhof		gopher.black	70
iphenomenon or other cognative biases.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo what do studies of that have to say? From the article above,		gopher.black	70
ia "systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive		gopher.black	70
iresults, noting that 7 of 17 studies had 'small, but significant,		gopher.black	70
ieffect sizes' but the review noted that the three most		gopher.black	70
imethodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant		gopher.black	70
ifindings". Overall, there's just not a lot of rigorous research		gopher.black	70
ibeing done. Even if we did have reliable results, prayer		gopher.black	70
irepresents only a small fraction of the occult magickal practices		gopher.black	70
iin the world, and prayer itself has thousands of forms and formats		gopher.black	70
ito consider.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo where do we go from there? Let me start by pointing out that		gopher.black	70
iafter thousands of years of advancement and the advent of western		gopher.black	70
imedicine, the Chinese still widely practice their traditional		gopher.black	70
imedicine. That alone speaks to its efficacy. The west is bringing		gopher.black	70
iover learnings from China every day.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd that brings me to my next point: occult practices are occult		gopher.black	70
ibecause they are unknown. The paranormal describes things outside		gopher.black	70
iof normal experience. Occult practices once included metalurgy.		gopher.black	70
iWhat we don't fully understand is often ignored and denegrated		gopher.black	70
irather than explored and investigated. There is a staggering		gopher.black	70
iamount of knowledge we have confirmed through science only		gopher.black	70
ihundreds of years of casual practice. As an example, the entire		gopher.black	70
ifield of optics existed and flourished for centuries before we		gopher.black	70
iunderstood the science of shaping glass.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOur understanding of the effects may be limited, but out		gopher.black	70
iunderstanding of the method is almost completely absent. In one of		gopher.black	70
ithe prayer studies there was no significance in those prayed for		gopher.black	70
ivs those not, but there was a lift in those that knew they were		gopher.black	70
ibeing prayed for. Perhaps when it comes to immune responses we		gopher.black	70
ihave a greater power to manipulate the physical in ourselves than		gopher.black	70
iin others through will alone. Perhaps this one of the infinite		gopher.black	70
ivarieties of action wasn't the specific one needed.		gopher.black	70

i         ---------- Narrowing the Scope ---------- 		gopher.black	70
i          		gopher.black	70
iHas any of this answered christyotwisty's pertenant question? Not		gopher.black	70
iquite yet. Let's reiterate in case you've forgotten where we're		gopher.black	70
iaiming with all this:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Those who use #magick to #manifest a material desire: what is it		gopher.black	70
i  about the manifestation that tells you it's magick and not		gopher.black	70
i  Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe question does not question that a manifestation has taken		gopher.black	70
iplace, but instead seeks to understand how you can confidently		gopher.black	70
icredit it to the magickal act rather than any number of cognative		gopher.black	70
ibiases or coincidence. To properly answer this I have to point to		gopher.black	70
ithree seminal works in religious study:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Idea of the Holy (Das Heilige) by Rudolf Otto published in the		gopher.black	70
iearly 20th century. It has never gone out of print and it has been		gopher.black	70
iabsolutely instrumental in the development of comparative religion		gopher.black	70
ias a field of scholarly study. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Sacred and the Profane by Mircea Elliade, who I referenced		gopher.black	70
iearlier. Elliade takes up the mantle that Otto laid down and takes		gopher.black	70
iit to the next level. Notably, he discusses how the myths and		gopher.black	70
istories of a people lead to the creation of their symbols. Those		gopher.black	70
isymbols lead to an experience of hierophany, or a breaking through		gopher.black	70
iof the profane world to glimpse the Sacred and its Mysterium		gopher.black	70
iTremendum, to feel fascinated, terrified, and infinitely the		gopher.black	70
i"creature" in the midst of creation. This relationship through		gopher.black	70
iculture and symbols to find a common experience of the Sacred		gopher.black	70
icrosses all known boundaries and shares almost identical patterns		gopher.black	70
iin the Eastern Orthodox Church as it does in Aboriginal tribes of		gopher.black	70
iAustralia or the Lenape Indians in America.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Varieties of Religious Experience by William James. This was		gopher.black	70
ia book written from James' lectures in Scotland on the various		gopher.black	70
itypes of personal expressions of religious understanding. There		gopher.black	70
iare many, many ways that people relate to the divine or the		gopher.black	70
iSacred, even if they consider that Sacred an unconscious power and		gopher.black	70
inot a diety. Those experiences have many things in common and fit		gopher.black	70
iinto categories that allow for discussion of the experience		gopher.black	70
iwithout having to dwell on the truth of that experience.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTaken together these books tell a story without a narrative. It is		gopher.black	70
ithe story of a people, of all people, and our relationship to		gopher.black	70
ipowers beyond our conceptualization that we yearn for in a million		gopher.black	70
iways and experience in glimpses between breaths. The truth of the		gopher.black	70
istories that lead to these experiences is not as important as the		gopher.black	70
ifact that we all reach the same experiences once we get there. The		gopher.black	70
isymbols change, but that moment of connection with the divine is		gopher.black	70
ia spark of Truth that rings inside us and overwhelms doubt.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iChristy, you ask how you know whether your manifestation comes		gopher.black	70
ifrom magick. The science is still out, but the experience is		gopher.black	70
iredily accessible. Choose your own pathway and look for the Truth		gopher.black	70
ithat resonates deep inside your spirit. Ultimately the confidence		gopher.black	70
ithat something comes from a magickal place will come from an		gopher.black	70
iunderstanding that something has happened that is beyond the		gopher.black	70
inormal world and has pierced that layer separatating the Sacred.		gopher.black	70
iThere is a feeling in it that can be communicated and shared.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAsk a priest how they heard the call and watch for that smile.		gopher.black	70
iThat's how you know.		gopher.black	70
