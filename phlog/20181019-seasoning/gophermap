iI recently acquired a pair of beautiful pans. You may already be		gopher.black	70
iaware that I have a distinct preference for cast iron cookware,		gopher.black	70
iand so it may surprise you to learn that these pans are different.		gopher.black	70
iInstead of cast iron, these pans are wrought iron!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iUS-ION ran a kickstarter [0] for what they call "Solidteknics Iron		gopher.black	70
iSkillets". They've developed a machining process allowing them to		gopher.black	70
imass produce wrought iron instead of cast iron. The result is		gopher.black	70
itheoretically both lighter and more durable. Quite a claim!		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iCast iron (and now wrought iron) cookware is an heirloom item.		gopher.black	70
iRather than buy-it-for-life, it's buy-it-for-generations. That's		gopher.black	70
ivalue I can get behind! This lifespan doesn't come without some		gopher.black	70
ieffort, though. You must care for your stuff if you want it to		gopher.black	70
ilast. This is true of pretty much everything, but it bears		gopher.black	70
irepeating. My lovely leather shoes need polish. My knives need		gopher.black	70
isharpening and oil. Iron needs seasoning.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat is seasoning? In layman's terms, it's a coating of oil that		gopher.black	70
igoes through a chemical bonding to the surface of your pan. It		gopher.black	70
iprotects the iron and makes it non-stick. It's safe! It won't		gopher.black	70
ibreak down and poison you like other **coughTEFLONcough**		gopher.black	70
icoatings.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIs it a lot of work? I don't think so, but others disagree.		gopher.black	70
iThere's also about 7,000 different opinions on how best to keep		gopher.black	70
ia pan clean over time, "properly" season it, etc. Here's my		gopher.black	70
imethod; you can decide for yourself if it's too much work.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iBrand new iron is naked and fragile. If you buy an unseasoned pan		gopher.black	70
iit may look like steel or it may be black already. Regardless, it		gopher.black	70
ineeds some extra special care right in the beginning to get things		gopher.black	70
ioff to the best start. Putting on the initial layers of oil is the		gopher.black	70
islowest part and requires the most effort. After this, upkeep is		gopher.black	70
iextremely simple.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTo season a cast iron (or wrought iron) you'll need the following:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - sandpaper, fine grit		gopher.black	70
i  - a clean cotton rag or old t-shirt		gopher.black	70
i  - a can/tub of vegetable shortening		gopher.black	70
i  - the pan/skillet/dutch oven/whatever		gopher.black	70
i  - an oven that can reach 480°F		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Begin by thoroughly scouring the pan clean. It may have shipped		gopher.black	70
i   with beeswax coating to protect it in transit, or there may be		gopher.black	70
i   old layers of seasoning to work off. Hot water, scrub with		gopher.black	70
i   soap, do it to it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. Dry the pan by hand, and then in the oven under low heat until		gopher.black	70
i   you're sure there's no moisture on it at all.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. Lightly scratch up everything with the sandpaper. Roughing the		gopher.black	70
i   surface will help the first layer of oil bonding.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i4. Heat your oven to 480°F or there-abouts.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i5. Dab your cloth into the shortening, then rub it over the whole		gopher.black	70
i   pan, inside and out. Make sure you get the handle too. Don't		gopher.black	70
i   leave anything untouched. You don't need a lot of shortening or		gopher.black	70
i   a thick coat. In fact, the thinner the better. Wipe it on and		gopher.black	70
i   then use a clean part of the rag to wipe it off again.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i6. Place the pan upside down into the oven. Cook it for 90		gopher.black	70
i   minutes.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i7. Turn off the heat and allow the pan to cool completely.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i8. This is the sucky part. Now that you've put a single coat on		gopher.black	70
i   your pan, it probably doesn't look too different. It may have		gopher.black	70
i   darkened slightly or maybe not. This initial process needs to		gopher.black	70
i   be done at least twice more. If you have the time over the next		gopher.black	70
i   couple days you should do it as much as you can. I usually do		gopher.black	70
i   five or six iterations. Go back and repeat steps 4-7. You don't		gopher.black	70
i   need the sandpaper on every round. You can use it a second time		gopher.black	70
i   after that first seasoning if you want, but I don't bother		gopher.black	70
i   after that.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i9. Your pan is now mostly seasoned, but it can use a little extra		gopher.black	70
i   love in the cooking area still. For this secondary seasoning,		gopher.black	70
i   we'll use your stove top! Crank the heat on a burner to high		gopher.black	70
i   and get ready.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i10. Add a thin layer of shortening to the inside of your pan and		gopher.black	70
i    also a bit to the base, but don't bother with the handle this		gopher.black	70
i    time. We're focused on the cooking area.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i11. Place the pan on the burner, but get ready with your cotton		gopher.black	70
i    rag. Wrap it around a wooden spoon or grab it in some tongs so		gopher.black	70
i    you can use it on the pan while it's on the heat.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i12. For the next minute or two, continuously wipe the cotton on		gopher.black	70
i    the pan while it heats up. This will cause it to smoke A LOT.		gopher.black	70
i    Open some windows, turn on a fan, etc. Let it smoke like this		gopher.black	70
i    for up to 30 seconds, then cut the heat.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i13. Allow the pan to cool for 10 minutes, then repeat steps 9-13		gopher.black	70
i    a few more times.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYour pan should be uniformly black. It should not feel sticky or		gopher.black	70
itacky to the touch. If it does, you have too much oil on it still		gopher.black	70
iand it didn't fully bake in. Wipe it down with a clean cloth and		gopher.black	70
itoss it in the oven at 480°F again for another 30 min to get		gopher.black	70
ieverything fully baked in.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou can use this thing to cook now! But cook on what? That's the		gopher.black	70
ibest part. You can cook on anything from an induction stove to an		gopher.black	70
iopen fire. It's so versitile!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou might notice a little sticking of delicate foods like eggs		gopher.black	70
i& fish when you first start using it. That's because your		gopher.black	70
iseasoning is just at its beginning. That effort may have seemed		gopher.black	70
ilike a little or a lot, but it's the start of the long road of		gopher.black	70
imaintenance that will make your pan better and better with every		gopher.black	70
iuse.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iEvery time you use the pan you need to clean it. This should also		gopher.black	70
igo without saying, but people get really weird about cast iron and		gopher.black	70
ilogic seems to go out the window. Much conventional wisdom says		gopher.black	70
ithat you don't need soap, or SHOULD NEVER USE SOAP, with your pan.		gopher.black	70
iI'm here to tell you that's a bunch of crap. Please use soap.		gopher.black	70
iClean your pan well. Stay healthy. Don't be gross. But how...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Clean of the physical bits from your pan with a hard plastic		gopher.black	70
i   scraper or metal that won't gouge the seasoning. I have a 6"		gopher.black	70
i   square of chainmail that I use. Don't press super hard, just		gopher.black	70
i   get all the stuff off the surface.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. Soap and water and clean the thing like you would any other		gopher.black	70
i   pan. Seriously. It's fine. If you want to be extra cautious,		gopher.black	70
i   don't use a lemon based cleaner. Acids wear down seasoning (not		gopher.black	70
i   that fast).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP!!!! Dry the everliving shit out of that		gopher.black	70
i   pan. I hand dry mine and then immediately place them back on		gopher.black	70
i   a burner and crank it to medium heat to cook off any lingering		gopher.black	70
i   water. Soap doesn't harm anything, but it will if little bits		gopher.black	70
i   of it remain on the surface. Water will do much, much worse.		gopher.black	70
i   Rust sucks (though even that can be fixed).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i4. While the pan is still warm from the drying heat, dab a bit of		gopher.black	70
i   vegetable shortening on a rag and do a quick surface rub on the		gopher.black	70
i   inside and base (don't do the handle unless you plan on putting		gopher.black	70
i   it back in the oven to bake).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i5. Crank a burner to high heat and cook & smoke that shortening		gopher.black	70
i   for a minute or two. Then congratulate yourself on adding yet		gopher.black	70
i   another layer of seasoning to your awesome pan of awesome. This		gopher.black	70
i   is what will build up more and more over time and turn it into		gopher.black	70
i   the only pan you ever want to use for cooking anything ever.		gopher.black	70
i   Ever.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i6. Let it cool, and put it away for 20 minutes until you can't		gopher.black	70
i   wait to use it again!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's it. That's my routine with all my iron. The new wrought		gopher.black	70
iiron pans are on seasoning #4 in the oven cooling. They'll get two		gopher.black	70
imore rounds today before I start the stove top. Does that seem		gopher.black	70
ilike a lot of work to you? I bet my grand children will appreciate		gopher.black	70
iit when they inherit the super skillets.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOne final note: if you have cast iron that has rusted, it is		gopher.black	70
iprobably still fine as long as it hasn't created a pit or hole.		gopher.black	70
iYou can sand off the rust, or in extreme cases you can use some		gopher.black	70
ihome chemistry to remove all the rust through electrolysis [1].		gopher.black	70
iOnce the rust is gone, go to the start of my initial seasoning		gopher.black	70
iinstructions and act like it's a new pan. A day or two later and		gopher.black	70
iit's back to working order. If you're a thrifty person you can		gopher.black	70
ipick up old cast iron from yard sales or flea markets for		gopher.black	70
ia dollar, put in some elbow grease with your shortening, and have		gopher.black	70
ia brilliant cookware set!		gopher.black	70
