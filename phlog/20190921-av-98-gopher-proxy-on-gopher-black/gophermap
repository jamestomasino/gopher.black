iIn it he shares the secret of an awesome little project, agena,		gopher.black	70
ithat is a gopher to gemini proxy. AV-98 is already capable of		gopher.black	70
iusing it out of the box, you just need a proxy to point to.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWell, gopher.black is happy to be your Huckleberry. If you use		gopher.black	70
iAV-98 you can try it out now.		gopher.black	70

i    AV-98> set gopher_proxy gopher.black:1965		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's it. I think you can set that in a config file too, if I'm		gopher.black	70
inot mistaken. Then, if you browse past the limits of gemspace and		gopher.black	70
ihit gopher your adventures will just keep going.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI may add this to tilde.black on a different port (since 1965 is		gopher.black	70
ialready in use for that server's gemini pages). If you are extra,		gopher.black	70
iridiculously paranoid you could then torify your AV-98 session and		gopher.black	70
ihit the tilde.black proxy over tor. You're welcome, Mr. Snowden.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSolderpunk has lots of improvements planned for it, so I expect		gopher.black	70
iagena to grow up real fast.		gopher.black	70

iI'm now running agena on tilde.black on port 1966 as well.		gopher.black	70
