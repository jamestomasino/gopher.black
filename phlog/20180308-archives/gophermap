iJynx reminded [0] me I never acknowledged a pretty big change in
imy phlog listing when I archived 2017 posts. I know there was some
italk about breaking links by moving posts around and wanted to let
ieveryone know there's nothing to worry about here. Like jynx my
iposts haven't moved. I just changed the gophermap in the phlog
idirectory to limit things to this year and I copied the links from
i2017 into a second gophermap.
i
iIt was a really easy change and I just did it by hand. I don't
ithink I'll bother making a script for it or a crazy cron. Who
iknows, by the time july comes around I may decide the archive
ishould be by month instead of year. Whatever changes will just be
ithe view, not the posts.
