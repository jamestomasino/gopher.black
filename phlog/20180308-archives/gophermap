 Jynx reminded [0] me I never acknowledged a pretty big change in
 my phlog listing when I archived 2017 posts. I know there was some
 talk about breaking links by moving posts around and wanted to let
 everyone know there's nothing to worry about here. Like jynx my
 posts haven't moved. I just changed the gophermap in the phlog
 directory to limit things to this year and I copied the links from
 2017 into a second gophermap.
 
 It was a really easy change and I just did it by hand. I don't
 think I'll bother making a script for it or a crazy cron. Who
 knows, by the time july comes around I may decide the archive
 should be by month instead of year. Whatever changes will just be
 the view, not the posts.
