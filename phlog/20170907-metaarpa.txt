MetaARPA
September 07th, 2017
----------------------------------------

I've moved up to MetaARPA status on SDF, so I finally have access to some
of the most vital shell tools in my arsenal: tmux & git. I have cloned my
dotfiles down and set everything up properly, and I have my weechat
session riding in a tmux pane like God intended.

Still on my list of things to "fix" about SDF:

    - Weechat needs to be rebuilt with python & perl plugin support
    - Newsbeuter needs to be compiled from the latest git source to work
      at all
    - GNU stow should be installed so I don't need to manually symlink
      everything all the time
    - FZF would be helpful. Not sure why that's failing to install the
      binary for NetBSD

I have requests on bboard for a few of those. Anyone wanna help out?
