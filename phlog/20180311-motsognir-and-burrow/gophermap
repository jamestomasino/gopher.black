iThis new gopher hole is running a brand new server called
iMotsognir [0]. It's written by mateusz [1] in c and has pretty
imuch no dependencies. It was an absolute breeze to install.

iMotsognir is far more strict about gophermaps than Gophernicus
iwas, and it required a bit of cleanup to get my things showing
iproperly. I think this is a good thing, though. I want my gopher
irepo to be portable in case I ever switch servers again, so
iauthoring things to the standard has benefits. The biggest
idifference is that Gophernicus allowed you to write gophermap
iinformation lines without a prefix of "i". This is great for
iquickly editing things and I knew I'd miss it. So, I've updated
iburrow [2] to automatically add these when creating a new post and
itemporarily remove them when editing posts. Handy, right? Side
ibenefit: the rewrite of that code means I'm no longer limited to
ilinks at the bottom of posts. I can drop them in wherever and
iburrow will just handle it.
