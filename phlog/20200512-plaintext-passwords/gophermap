iA recent set of exchanges on the fediverse reminded me that		gopher.black	70
ithere's still plenty of poorly run websites and institutions who		gopher.black	70
iare still storing user credentials in plain text. Yes, unencrypted		gopher.black	70
iplain text.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI remember the horror in my heart back in 2008 when I was trying		gopher.black	70
ito learn about virtual credit cards from my bank (a cool idea		gopher.black	70
iwhich went away for no good reason). I was on the phone and the		gopher.black	70
icustomer service representative asked me for the 3rd and 5th		gopher.black	70
iletter in my password to verify my identity.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDid it hit you too? Did that little pit in your stomach open up		gopher.black	70
ilike it did for me? How could this person know a specific		gopher.black	70
icharacter in my password?		gopher.black	70

iNeedless to say, the conversation I had with the bank that day		gopher.black	70
iquickly changed. I wish that was the only time I had the		gopher.black	70
iexperience, but it happened a second time in the same year in		gopher.black	70
ia conversation with Fidelity, who ran my 401k at my job at the		gopher.black	70
itime. In that case I was stuck. I couldn't choose to move my 401k		gopher.black	70
ito another provider. Thanks America.		gopher.black	70

iAnyway, there's a ton of these places including a downright scary		gopher.black	70
inumber of banks (looking at you Tesco). I figured gopher needed		gopher.black	70
isome place to reference the list of shame, so I made one [0] over		gopher.black	70
iin my Experiments section. There's a link over there to the master		gopher.black	70
ilist managed in github as well. If you have others to add, make		gopher.black	70
ia PR and help shame them.		gopher.black	70
