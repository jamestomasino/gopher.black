iI've been thinking about writing some interactive fiction, or at	
ileast a choose-your-own-adventure story. I want to do it on gopher	
iusing gophermaps, keeping it as simple as links at the end of each	
isection. Any suggestions for a subject, theme, genre? I don't want	
ito tackle anything too long since I'll have to write all the	
idifferent variations.	
i	
iHave any of you done one of these before? I was going to plot it	
iout on notecards first and write the scenes from there. Is there	
ia better way?
