iThere's been a lot of people talking recently about games they're		gopher.black	70
iplaying, whether on the computer, board game, or pencil-based		gopher.black	70
iRPGs. It's been really inspiring.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI love RPGs so much, and I'm happy that I've got a monthly game		gopher.black	70
igoing with a local crew. We're playing online with Discord and		gopher.black	70
iRoll20.net and it's... fair. I prefer no electronics involved in		gopher.black	70
imy table-top, and everyone around the same table. Still, I'll take		gopher.black	70
iwhat I can get.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAt work I spent a little bit of my team-building budget to buy		gopher.black	70
ia couple board games. Charterstone, a fancy new legacy game, and		gopher.black	70
ia casual game called Lattice are the first purchases. I'll report		gopher.black	70
iback on how they work soon.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've also been thinking about other games I play or have played		gopher.black	70
iwith my friends over the years. Some are easily categorized, like		gopher.black	70
ithe D&D campaigns I've run or played in. Others are hard to pin		gopher.black	70
idown, like the De Profundis writing-game I've got here on		gopher.black	70
igopher.black [0].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
1[0] De Profundis	/writing/deprofundis
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is a game of sorts, but it's also collaborative writing. It		gopher.black	70
istarted with the first letter when I wrote it in an email to my		gopher.black	70
ifriend Dan. I didn't give much explanation other than, "you get to		gopher.black	70
iwrite from the other side and move the story along." We don't		gopher.black	70
icommunicate about our plans for each letter and we can introduce		gopher.black	70
icharacters as we see fit. We meticulously research historical		gopher.black	70
ilocations and events to prepare each one, and try to keep to the		gopher.black	70
istyle of the time as best as we're able. Dan's got the next letter		gopher.black	70
icoming my way soon and I'm thrilled.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy game experience isn't all table-top or computer based, of		gopher.black	70
icourse. When I was a teen in Boy Scouts we did a lot of		gopher.black	70
inight-gaming. Usually it was something akin to capture the flag,		gopher.black	70
ior a moderately violent hide-and-seek variant we called Man Hunt.		gopher.black	70
iMy favorite thing was what I called "Flee-running". If you're		gopher.black	70
ifamiliar with Free Running or Parkour, it's more in line with the		gopher.black	70
ilatter. It wasn't about flourishes, but rather about getting from		gopher.black	70
ipoint A to point B as efficiently as possible. The only difference		gopher.black	70
iwas, you were being chased. It's a combination of tag & parkour		gopher.black	70
iusually played deep in the woods, often in the dark. It's skill		gopher.black	70
ibased only so much as it takes a lot of skill not to stop running		gopher.black	70
iwhen you take a branch to the face in the middle of the night. It		gopher.black	70
iwas so thrilling, though. I've lept from cabin roofs, tarzan'd		gopher.black	70
iacross creeks, and jumped through windows. So dangerous, and so		gopher.black	70
ifun.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe also had really stupid high school games. There's one that		gopher.black	70
iI picked up on in college that started from a friend's high school		gopher.black	70
itime. It's really simple, if someone says the word "bogwan" you		gopher.black	70
ihave to freeze exactly where you are in the position you're in for		gopher.black	70
ithirty seconds. If it's dangerous or whatever, then you don't...		gopher.black	70
ibut once you're clear of danger you have to freeze. It was mostly		gopher.black	70
iused to emphasize some stupid expression you were making at the		gopher.black	70
itime. Make some embarrasing face and you're bound to be bogwan'd.		gopher.black	70
iIt's still active and on rare occasion I'll get a bogwan text from		gopher.black	70
ithat crew.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's so many other stupid games from that time. A lot of them		gopher.black	70
iinvolve getting punched in the balls, for some reason. High school		gopher.black	70
iagain, I guess.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBoard games are coming back into my life again which is great.		gopher.black	70
iI've got one RPG going and will likely run a Numenera game		gopher.black	70
isometime in the next year. I'm doing a retro-gaming playthrough of		gopher.black	70
ithe complete Zelda franchise and occasionally twitch stream it.		gopher.black	70
iI'm 8bitino on Twitch, but I rarely go on. I'm about halfway		gopher.black	70
ithrough Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It's hard! Next up will		gopher.black	70
ibe the Game Boy games, and I'm really excited.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI also am in a slow retro-playthrough of the Quest for Glory		gopher.black	70
iseries. I rocked QFG1 in style on Twitch not too long ago. I have		gopher.black	70
imy saved character for QFG2, but I'm going to restart it now that		gopher.black	70
iI found a VGA version. The most exciting thing about this		gopher.black	70
iplaythrough is that I've never played QFG5. I stopped at #4 and		gopher.black	70
iloved it so much, but 5 came out after I'd moved on to other		gopher.black	70
ithings. EEEk, so much fun!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn a future post I'd like to cover off on some of the RPG		gopher.black	70
icampaigns I've run in the past. The Assassini is probably my best		gopher.black	70
ione, so I think I'll start there. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAssassini		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSetting: 1716 Paris 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMission: Two agents of the Catholic Church, armed with Papal		gopher.black	70
idispensation, have been dispatched to undermine the political		gopher.black	70
ipower in the region, uncover a religious mystery, and combat		gopher.black	70
iagents of the British Crown who seek to disrupt their plans.		gopher.black	70
