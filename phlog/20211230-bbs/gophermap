iI installed WWIV on one of my VMs. I walked through all the set up		gopher.black	70
iand got it all configured out of some spark of nostalgia. Then		gopher.black	70
iwhen it was done and ready to start adding content I decided I had		gopher.black	70
ino content I wanted to share in a BBS. I have enough channels for		gopher.black	70
imy creative outputs already. Too many, really.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo I deleted it.		gopher.black	70

iIt was too easy to conflate the installation and configuration of		gopher.black	70
ia BBS as "having a BBS" in my head. I wanted to recapture the		gopher.black	70
ifeeling of the BBS days and the setup process faked its way into		gopher.black	70
imy day masquarading as a solution. The BBS experience was one of		gopher.black	70
icommunity, though, and of reaching out for a bit of nerdy contact		gopher.black	70
ithat pierced a veil of separatation. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat veil doesn't exist anymore. The internet killed it. And so		gopher.black	70
iwhat is left to penetrate? I already have contact with you here.		gopher.black	70

iDo I add door games to this little corner of the internet and		gopher.black	70
ientice you with FIDONet access? Maybe I dust off Phrack archives		gopher.black	70
ior ANSi art galleries? With a lot of work I could decorate my		gopher.black	70
ispace like the ones of my youth and possibly entice visitors for		gopher.black	70
ia drive-by of the museum I'd created, but that's still a pale		gopher.black	70
iapproximation.		gopher.black	70
