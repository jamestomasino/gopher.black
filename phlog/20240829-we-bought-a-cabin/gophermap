iHey! I bought a cabin. Well, it finalizes in a week or two. But		gopher.black	70
iit's just about ours!		gopher.black	70

iIt's 40 minutes to my north, in a mountain valley well away from		gopher.black	70
iany city lights. It's called a summer cabin here in Iceland, but		gopher.black	70
ithe name is a misnomer. It's accessible year round and commonly		gopher.black	70
iused in winter. This one has 3 bedrooms, sleeps 6 comfortably, has		gopher.black	70
ia big deck, play house for a kiddo, sand pit, yard, garden, and		gopher.black	70
iall the comfortable utilities of home.		gopher.black	70

iI can't wait to have TTRPG getaway weekends with my gaming group!		gopher.black	70

iWe're also going to rent it out a bit, but not a ton. The fees		gopher.black	70
iaren't very high to keep it up, but we want to make the place make		gopher.black	70
ienough income so it's self sufficient.		gopher.black	70

iMore to come!		gopher.black	70
