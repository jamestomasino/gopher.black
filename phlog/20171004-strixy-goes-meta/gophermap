iOfficial welcomes to strixy [0] who recently joined MetaARPA. He
igot set up on the meta array today and made his way into IRC in
ithe #gopher channel on irc.sdf.org. If you're reading this and
ihaven't popped in to say hi, what are you doing with your life?!
i
iStrixy also gave me a nifty new shell function that I've added to
imy prompt. It outputs the current time in Swatch Internet Time [1],
ilike so:
i
i@344
i
iPretty neat, eh? I thought so! If I were him, I'd add a cgi script
ito his gopher hole so other people can check the swatch internet
itime over gopher. (HINT HINT)
i
iWelcome to meta, strixy!
