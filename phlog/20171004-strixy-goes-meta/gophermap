 Strixy goes Meta
 October 04th, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 Official welcomes to strixy [0] who recently joined MetaARPA. He
 got set up on the meta array today and made his way into IRC in
 the #gopher channel on irc.sdf.org. If you're reading this and
 haven't popped in to say hi, what are you doing with your life?!
 
 Strixy also gave me a nifty new shell function that I've added to
 my prompt. It outputs the current time in Swatch Internet Time [1],
 like so:
 
 @344
 
 Pretty neat, eh? I thought so! If I were him, I'd add a cgi script
 to his gopher hole so other people can check the swatch internet
 time over gopher. (HINT HINT)
 
 Welcome to meta, strixy!
