iToday marked the arrival of my newest mechanical keyboard,		gopher.black	70
ia Planck from Massdrop. Planck is an ortholinear, minimalist,		gopher.black	70
imechanical keyboard. It's just 4 rows tall (no number row or		gopher.black	70
iFkeys). It supports multiple layers, though, so you can switch		gopher.black	70
ibetween keymaps, or meta-layers, or whatever else floats your		gopher.black	70
iboat. Right now I'm running with two layers [0]:		gopher.black	70

i - Dvorak		gopher.black	70
i - Num-pad & arrows		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Planck comes as a kit that you need to assemble. That means		gopher.black	70
ilaying out the PCB and base plate and popping all the key switches		gopher.black	70
iin to place (careful to align the pins just right). Then there was		gopher.black	70
ia great deal of soldering. I'm happy to say it went smoothly and		gopher.black	70
iI had no issues with my joints whatsoever. The board is then		gopher.black	70
iscrewed into the milled bottom, some rubber feet are attached, and		gopher.black	70
iyou're good to go.		gopher.black	70

iIn my case I also had to flash the firmware to get my sexy layout		gopher.black	70
iinstalled. There was a hiccup there as the software I was using to		gopher.black	70
icreate the layout had placed the spacebar in the wrong location.		gopher.black	70
iEverything worked but the space! I actually took it all apart,		gopher.black	70
iremove the switch, resoldered in a replacement, only to find out		gopher.black	70
ithat it wasn't a hardware issue at all. I changed one setting in		gopher.black	70
imy firmware and we're all good again.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'll need to practice using it, especially the layer changes.		gopher.black	70
iHere's hoping I pick it up quickly. I suspect this will become my		gopher.black	70
ifavorite little keyboard buddy.		gopher.black	70
