iWeird day

iI'm having a really weird day. I've been exhausted since waking,	
itook an extra nap in the middle of the day, and I can't stand to	
ibe around people, even my family. I'm hiding out by the laptop,	
ibut I don't have energy to do anything significant here either.	
iWhat a funk! Maybe I'm getting sick.	
i	
iUm, I fixed a burrow thing that was messing up my gophermap "Last	
iUpdated" string. I was putting the directory into the string	
ireplacement instead of the server address, and the directory had	
ia slash that was conflicting with the sed line itself. I fixed	
iboth and it's working again. v1.3.3.	
i	
iI've got a Creation Crate build I could do. It's a light-up memory	
igame, like Simon. I'm having a lot of problems getting the	
imotivation to start. Maybe I should just go back to bed and try	
ithis day over tomorrow.
