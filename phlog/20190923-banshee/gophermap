iI have an idea for a thing. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow, I get a lot of ideas for things and some of them are just too		gopher.black	70
ibig for me to do in a reasonable timeframe. Sometimes they're so		gopher.black	70
ibig my eyes glaze over at the very thought, so I just tell		gopher.black	70
ieveryone else in a blog or phlog and hope someone else does it.		gopher.black	70
iSometimes the idea is so dumb that I know I'm the only hope and		gopher.black	70
ihave to do it myself. Sometimes the timinging is such that it		gopher.black	70
ineeds to be done right away or it's not relevant. Sometimes time		gopher.black	70
idoesn't matter and I can just ignore it until I'm bored one night.		gopher.black	70
iIn my head this all adds up to a sort of Eisenhower decision		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iWell, now I've got an idea for  +-----------------------------+		gopher.black	70
ia project that is too big for   | One of the reasons (not the |		gopher.black	70
ime to do in a weekend, but it   | #1, but up there) that      |		gopher.black	70
imight actually matter to        | I wanted to move to Iceland |		gopher.black	70
ipeople. Do I just go for it and | was to get away from coding |		gopher.black	70
idrop all the other things I've  | for evil (pharma, mostly)   |		gopher.black	70
igot going? Ugh, probably not,   | and get around to doing     |		gopher.black	70
ibut I need to come up with a    | something for the betterment|		gopher.black	70
ireal plan if I have any hope of | of people. I haven't found  |		gopher.black	70
iaccomplishing the goal.         | a lot of opportunity for    |		gopher.black	70
i                                | that just yet, but I'm      |		gopher.black	70
iBut I never said what this is   | getting there.              |		gopher.black	70
iall about, did I?               +-----------------------------+		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo what is it?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to make an easily deployable system that creates a platform		gopher.black	70
ifor publishing text which does so on web, gopher, gemini, and any		gopher.black	70
iother logical systems, is made available on tor, IPFS, zero-web,		gopher.black	70
iand so on (RSS, fediverse?, moar). Basically, I want you to be		gopher.black	70
iable to click "go" and spin up a server that will push your		gopher.black	70
itext-based content out into the wild on all possible channels at		gopher.black	70
imaximum volume. (Hence why this phost is called Banshee)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhy?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSome people have a hard time getting their voice out from behind		gopher.black	70
ifirewalls, oppressive regimes, and so on. I want to make it easy		gopher.black	70
ifor them to toss something on a raspberry pi, or spin up a virtual		gopher.black	70
imachine, or SOMETHING, and have a way to be heard.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHow?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI really don't know. I assume I could look into containers as		gopher.black	70
ia start. There's a heavy devops part of this that's not my		gopher.black	70
iwheel-house. Frankly, I think I'll need help.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm going to start up a tildegit org for this, stub out a repo		gopher.black	70
iwith a readme and get some conversations going. I think this could		gopher.black	70
ireally help people with real problems today. Hopefully it won't		gopher.black	70
ifall off my radar and into the "someday" category.		gopher.black	70
