iI'm so, so happy right now. I was just wondering if there was		gopher.black	70
ianything new in the phlogosphere and struck pure gold. Christy		gopher.black	70
iposted a new set of questions[0] for the month. These started out		gopher.black	70
ion gopher but lately she's moved them to gemini where, sadly,		gopher.black	70
iI have a tendency to miss them. Not this month, though! Huzzah!		gopher.black	70

iSo, let's see here...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Whom would you like to be for one day?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOooh, good one. If I were Bezos for a day how much money could		gopher.black	70
iI redistribute and how much is just tied up in stocks? I guess my		gopher.black	70
ichoices here are "who is using their life stupidly and me popping		gopher.black	70
iin for a day could fix it?" or "who has a really interesting life		gopher.black	70
iI want to experience for a day?" or "what would be totally silly?"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'd like to be a woman for a day, I think. That would be		gopher.black	70
iinteresting from an experiential stand-point. Or maybe someone who		gopher.black	70
iis super physically fit so I could use the body-machine to do		gopher.black	70
ithings I'm not normally able to do. Maybe a combo? A female rock		gopher.black	70
iclimber, perhaps?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. What did you yearn for in your childhood that your parent(s) never gave you?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think this would have been easier to answer when I was younger.		gopher.black	70
iThe further the distance grows the less of that sort of thing		gopher.black	70
iI remember. I wanted a Sega Genesis when they bought me an NES.		gopher.black	70
iI'm not upset with that, though. The NES was better for me in the		gopher.black	70
ilong run and I got so much joy from it. Maybe there's something		gopher.black	70
ibeyond the material I wanted but never got? I remember plenty of		gopher.black	70
iarguments and yelling, but I can't think of anything now that has		gopher.black	70
ilingered with me. Good job, parents!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. How do you know when it's time to ask for help?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOof, that's a hard one and I'm not great at it. Professionally		gopher.black	70
iit's easier. I weigh whether it's more likely to hurt me to ask or		gopher.black	70
ifail and then act. In those cases a conversation feels easy. But		gopher.black	70
ithere's a heavier burden when it's a private thing. I'll deal with		gopher.black	70
iit for much longer than is necessary because it feels like I'm		gopher.black	70
iputting a burden on others to ask for help. There's probably an		gopher.black	70
iaspect of pride inside saying I should be able to do this myself,		gopher.black	70
ialso. I like that feeling of independence.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI guess the simple answer is, once something is going to affect		gopher.black	70
isomeone else I break down and ask for help. For instance a couple		gopher.black	70
imonths ago when I threw out my back, at first I tried to deal with		gopher.black	70
iit and stretch things and shuffle around, but I quickly realized		gopher.black	70
iI was a mess and couldn't function. It was inevitable that I was		gopher.black	70
igoing to need my wife, so I spoke up. I probably should have		gopher.black	70
iraised a flag earlier when I felt things being not quite right,		gopher.black	70
ithough.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i4. Recommend, and provide a recipe if you have one, a refreshing summer beverage.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iUm, I don't have a name for it, but make an Arnold Palmer and then		gopher.black	70
iadd a dash of grenadine and a slice of lime. Better yet, make		gopher.black	70
isweet tea, southern style, then add in the lemonade, THEN the		gopher.black	70
igrenadine. It's ridiculously sweet and probably will give you		gopher.black	70
idiabetes with a single glass, but there you go.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i5. Which childhood things do you still enjoy? 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI still draw. I still play video games. I like puzzles. I play		gopher.black	70
ipretend (tabletop role playing games). I like to cuddle up and		gopher.black	70
iwatch shows. I like to explore by hiking off-trails and looking at		gopher.black	70
iinteresting things. I love to find a good rock. I like to sneak		gopher.black	70
iaway with a friend and share secrets. :)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThank you, Christy. This was a joy.		gopher.black	70
