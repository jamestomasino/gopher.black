iWhile reading moji's phlog [0] I started considering how I read on		gopher.black	70
igopher, or in plain text in general versus my methods on the web.		gopher.black	70
iCertainly I do more scanning in a web browser, which I attribute		gopher.black	70
iat least partially to the various font and style treatments that		gopher.black	70
iboth allow for and promote the bite-sized ingestion of content.		gopher.black	70
iThere is also an element of reading fatigue that plays out		gopher.black	70
idifferently here in plain text, and thats where my mind went (not		gopher.black	70
ito say that moji was in any way tiring).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen I'm tired of reading on gopher it is instantly apparent.		gopher.black	70
iI skim over blocks of text looking for something to jump out at		gopher.black	70
ime, but that isnt how it works. Warning claxxons blare in my brain		gopher.black	70
iand I shut down figuratively and literally. It's clear I need to		gopher.black	70
ido something else and come back later. I get no such signal on the		gopher.black	70
iweb. I peruse long past the point of usefulness. I trade reading		gopher.black	70
ifor browsing. Surfing becomes skimming. Infinite scroll is		gopher.black	70
iinfinitely useless.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy time in text is short and productive in the sense that I get		gopher.black	70
isomething from it, whether information or entertainment. My time		gopher.black	70
ion the web offers sone of that, but the trappings are extreme and		gopher.black	70
iit is all too easy to give more time than necessary or helpful.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is intentional. Capitalism demands attention, and it is that		gopher.black	70
imonstrosity which guides the design patterns on port 80. Even		gopher.black	70
iinformational sites follow the patterns because that is what		gopher.black	70
idrives engagement. Look at the analytics, measure your performance		gopher.black	70
igoals. How do we keep them longer? How do we show them more ads?		gopher.black	70
iHow do we get them to spend a little more?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm sick of environmental leeches. I want my landscapes clear and		gopher.black	70
iclean. Mow down the billboards and flashing neon and let me get		gopher.black	70
iwhere I'm going on my own terms, please.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere is no way out on the web. The experience is condemned to		gopher.black	70
ithese patterns. People scream when you try to pull that bandage		gopher.black	70
ioff. They demand more convenience despite the cost. The masses		gopher.black	70
iwant to live like this. We're the weirdos for questioning it.		gopher.black	70
