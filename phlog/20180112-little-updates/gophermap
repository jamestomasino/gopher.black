 Little updates
 January 12th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I don't have a whole lot of cohesive stuff to say today, but
 I felt the need to phlog anyway. Here's some quick hits:
 
 - Welcome back Yin Feng. Love reading your gopher content and I'm
   glad you're phlogging again. Your background randomly overlaps
   with mine in a lot of ways, just like folks were talking about
   recently with regard to mechanical watches and so on. I was
   a Jesuit before leaving religious life, and I also have a lot of
   background with Buddhism. Keep it coming.
 
 - Speaking of random overlapping interests, I have 4 fountain
   pens, two mechanical watches, a sextant, abacus, slide rule,
   japanese sharpening stones, spinning wheel, and the list goes
   on. Old and ancient technology is my aesthetic, as the saying
   goes. I'm going to try to give more effort to sharing notes in
   my Explorations [0] section on these topics.
 
 - I mentioned that @louks@mastodon.sdf.org sent me an SGI Indigo2
   the other day. It arrived and it's amazing. I have some adaptors
   and things on the way, and I managed to find an original owners
   manual. I'll be writing about my efforts to get that up and
   running again in the Explorations section as well.
 
 - Tonight I play D&D (Pathfinder). I went years and years with no
   gaming and it was awful. Tabletop RPGs are my #1 favorite group
   activity and I'm so thrilled to be back in the swing. We don't
   play much, and it's online over Discord, but it's something.
   What I would give to find a local group into Fate.
 
 - I noticed Lynx doesn't support the + item type for gophermaps.
   I emailed the dev mailing list and they have put it on their
   to-do list to add in the future. I know a lot of gopher people
   are writing their own clients as well. I hope they'll share.
