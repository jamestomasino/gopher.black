iI don't have a whole lot of cohesive stuff to say today, but
iI felt the need to phlog anyway. Here's some quick hits:
i
i- Welcome back Yin Feng. Love reading your gopher content and I'm
i  glad you're phlogging again. Your background randomly overlaps
i  with mine in a lot of ways, just like folks were talking about
i  recently with regard to mechanical watches and so on. I was
i  a Jesuit before leaving religious life, and I also have a lot of
i  background with Buddhism. Keep it coming.
i
i- Speaking of random overlapping interests, I have 4 fountain
i  pens, two mechanical watches, a sextant, abacus, slide rule,
i  japanese sharpening stones, spinning wheel, and the list goes
i  on. Old and ancient technology is my aesthetic, as the saying
i  goes. I'm going to try to give more effort to sharing notes in
i  my Explorations [0] section on these topics.
i
i- I mentioned that @louks@mastodon.sdf.org sent me an SGI Indigo2
i  the other day. It arrived and it's amazing. I have some adaptors
i  and things on the way, and I managed to find an original owners
i  manual. I'll be writing about my efforts to get that up and
i  running again in the Explorations section as well.
i
i- Tonight I play D&D (Pathfinder). I went years and years with no
i  gaming and it was awful. Tabletop RPGs are my #1 favorite group
i  activity and I'm so thrilled to be back in the swing. We don't
i  play much, and it's online over Discord, but it's something.
i  What I would give to find a local group into Fate.
i
i- I noticed Lynx doesn't support the + item type for gophermaps.
i  I emailed the dev mailing list and they have put it on their
i  to-do list to add in the future. I know a lot of gopher people
i  are writing their own clients as well. I hope they'll share.
