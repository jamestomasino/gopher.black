iOn Feb 2, 2024 I formally renounced my US citizenship at the US		gopher.black	70
iEmbassy in Reykjavik Iceland.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's been a while coming. In fact, I knew this was something		gopher.black	70
iI wanted to strongly consider before we left the country. I had		gopher.black	70
irough plans for ~5 years abroad, and it happened at 4.7 years.		gopher.black	70
iPretty accurate!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI started the formal process back in October when I notified the		gopher.black	70
iembassy of my intentions. There were some back and forth emails		gopher.black	70
iand I eventually received an appointment date. I had to fill out		gopher.black	70
ia lot of repetitive forms, have a phone call that repeated what		gopher.black	70
iwas on the forms, and finally have the in-person appointment where		gopher.black	70
iit was all repeated again.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOnce the forms and signing were done I got to stand up in front of		gopher.black	70
ia flag I was literally telling these people I don't care about and		gopher.black	70
iI got to say a formal oath of un-American-ing. Or something. It		gopher.black	70
iwas very bazaar. Like, who was the oath for exactly? They didn't		gopher.black	70
irecord it or anything. It was so performative.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSpeaking of performative, the consular officer I met with was		gopher.black	70
ipretty creepy, in that Stepford Wives sort of way. She had		gopher.black	70
ia really fake pleasant thing going on, and offered up small talk		gopher.black	70
ithat was not really small talk. She kept asking questions, "just		gopher.black	70
iout of curiosity," which were obviously designed to probe me about		gopher.black	70
imy reasoning. Which was strange, since they literally ask about		gopher.black	70
ithe reasoning.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhy do they do that? Well, there's one very special provision in		gopher.black	70
ithe middle of all the lists. It says something to the effect of,		gopher.black	70
i"If the Attorney General decides you are doing this for tax		gopher.black	70
iavoidance you can be banned from entering the US." I think the		gopher.black	70
iquestions were to see if that was my reasoning.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThankfully, that's not my reason! My reason is that America is		gopher.black	70
ia shitbag. It was founded on racism, has been responsible for		gopher.black	70
icountless atrocities even before its founding, continues to impose		gopher.black	70
ihorrible ethics upon the world at the end of a gun, and		gopher.black	70
iindoctrinates its people in a cult of self delusion. But yeah,		gopher.black	70
igetting taxed as an expat is pretty annoying too. Not that I avoid		gopher.black	70
iit, it's just annoying.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo yeah, I'm done! It's both official and not official. It's		gopher.black	70
iofficial in all the ways that count outside the US. It's not		gopher.black	70
iofficial yet in the US as that requires them to do some absurd		gopher.black	70
iamount of paperwork or something and it'll take months. Right now		gopher.black	70
iI don't have my passport because they took it, but it technically		gopher.black	70
iis still issued and valid. So in a few months when I fly through		gopher.black	70
ithe US with my Italian passport and an ESTA, I risk a border		gopher.black	70
ipatrol agent deciding that's interesting enough to make my day		gopher.black	70
ihorrible. I don't really have any recourse, but then again that		gopher.black	70
icould have happened for no reason at all. That's how America rolls		gopher.black	70
ifor anyone with a badge. ACAB, bitches.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh! It cost me $2,300 to renounce. That's a nice little extra		gopher.black	70
ibullshit on top, isn't it? Whatever. It's done. I'm free. No, not		gopher.black	70
ilike in America, actually free.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm an Italian citizen, though I've never lived in Italy and		gopher.black	70
ihaven't spent a total of a full month in the country in my life.		gopher.black	70
iI'd like to spend more time there eventually. We've been		gopher.black	70
idiscussing that in the 6-8 year timeframe it would be great to buy		gopher.black	70
ia flat in Italy to spend our winters. Wit will be out of school by		gopher.black	70
ithen so it shouldn't create schedule problems. I work remotely, so		gopher.black	70
ias long as we find some place with decent internet it will be		gopher.black	70
igreat. And lets face it, Iceland is amazing, but it sucks monkey		gopher.black	70
ibutt in January and February.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo yeah, I'll get around to brushing up on my Italian and we'll		gopher.black	70
ilook into splitting up the year. Who knows, maybe when I'm ready		gopher.black	70
ito retire I'll like that more than Iceland (I doubt it). Then		gopher.black	70
iagain, I really love it here. I have about 2 and a half more years		gopher.black	70
ibefore I can apply for citizenship here. That will bring my		gopher.black	70
ipassport count back up to two!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPlans, plans, plans. Sometimes they work out.		gopher.black	70
