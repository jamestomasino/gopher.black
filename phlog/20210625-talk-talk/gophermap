iI've got a talk daemon running on cosmic.voyage. That's right, the		gopher.black	70
iold one-on-one real-time chat program 'talk(1)'. In fact, I've got		gopher.black	70
iytalk(1) installed, which is even better. This morning I was		gopher.black	70
italking about talk and realized I'd never seen an RFC for it. So		gopher.black	70
iI went looking...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd found nothing. There is no RFC for talk. At all. Others did		gopher.black	70
isome searching too and came up with the same result. I _did_ find		gopher.black	70
isome forums talking about their own search for and RFC and coming		gopher.black	70
ito the same conclusion. As best I can tell, the only way to figure		gopher.black	70
iout how it works is to look at the code running the clients and		gopher.black	70
ithe servers and work backwards. [0]		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iSo what? Well, in our little corner of internet history it seems		gopher.black	70
ilike quite an oversight. How did this awesome little tool get		gopher.black	70
imissed. It's mentioned by name in the netequette RFC [1] and		gopher.black	70
idiscussed at length, but there's no implementation rules actually		gopher.black	70
icodified anywhere. Wild!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[1] RFC 1855	URL:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1855
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's also a missed opportunity to breath new life into something		gopher.black	70
iancient. With a bit better documentation we could have new talk		gopher.black	70
idaemons and clients in a heartbeat. Look at that first link above		gopher.black	70
iand ask yourself how long it would take you to code your own today		gopher.black	70
iin C or Go or Python or Lua or Perl or Forth or whatever your		gopher.black	70
iparty language is? We could have sexy clients and robust servers		gopher.black	70
inext week. With the recent finger revival discovery of users is		gopher.black	70
isuper simple again in the tildeverse and other pubnixes. Layer in		gopher.black	70
isome good ol' fashioned talk and now we're cooking with gas.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd hey, since there's no bloody RFC to hold us back, why not slap		gopher.black	70
isome TLS on that bad-boy and make a neotalk that's secure, runs on		gopher.black	70
iUDP, has full unicode support, and I dunno... washes your car?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSomeone out there needs a pet project. How about this challenge:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Write up the docs!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSeriously! As the first step to help EVERYONE else, take a tour of		gopher.black	70
isearch engine results, the links up above, and put together a mini		gopher.black	70
iRFC-like doc on implementation. Share it around and lets see how		gopher.black	70
imany new talk developments we can get this summer. The summer of		gopher.black	70
italk!		gopher.black	70
