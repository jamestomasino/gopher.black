iAlex Schroeder wrote recently [0] about backup formats. It was an		gopher.black	70
iimportant reminder that since I'd moved everything (web, gopher,		gopher.black	70
i... is that everything?) to a raspberry pi and configured it all		gopher.black	70
ito a working state, I hadn't backed up the system. Granted, all		gopher.black	70
ithe content I have is in git, but the system configuration itself		gopher.black	70
iis worth quite a bit of work.		gopher.black	70

iEvidence of this can be found easily. Tonight after I did a backup		gopher.black	70
i(more on that in a second) I rebooted the machine and discovered		gopher.black	70
ithat bitlbee didn't start up correctly. I'm using kensanata's		gopher.black	70
ifabulous bitlbee-mastodon plugin [1] to do all my social media		gopher.black	70
ijunk via IRC. It's awesome, but it was a headache to get working.		gopher.black	70
iFor some reason I couldn't get it to play nice with the apt		gopher.black	70
iversion of Bitlbee, so I had to compile everything from source.		gopher.black	70
iTonight when bitlbee stopped responding I ended up trying the		gopher.black	70
iwhole process over again, eventually giving up on apt again, and		gopher.black	70
ireinstalling from source. (This time I properly set up systemd.)		gopher.black	70

iMastodon in Weechat is a minor thing, but it's evidence enough		gopher.black	70
ithat I don't want to have to rebuild the box. So, I unplugged the		gopher.black	70
ipi for a few minutes, removed the SD card, plugged it into another		gopher.black	70
imachine and 'dd' copied everything to an ISO. I don't think I need		gopher.black	70
ito worry about doing that too often, thankfully, as it means		gopher.black	70
idowntime for the box. If I ever needed to restore, I can flash		gopher.black	70
ia new SD card, plug it in, then run update on all the git repos.		gopher.black	70
iIt will pick up pretty much everything that way, unless I do some		gopher.black	70
iserious system additions.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think I'll do the full SD backup semi-annually, maybe when		gopher.black	70
iI change the batteries in my smoke detectors. It has a similar		gopher.black	70
isort of safety-maintenance feel.		gopher.black	70
