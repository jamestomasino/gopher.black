iSome of you guys were talking about a "federated gopher" on		gopher.black	70
iMastodon the other day. At first I was all into the idea and		gopher.black	70
igetting ready to chime in with support. But then I started		gopher.black	70
ithinking about what that would mean and I hit a wall. I think my		gopher.black	70
iunderstanding of federation in recent context has skewed away from		gopher.black	70
ithe community idea. With all the work on ActivityPub and the new		gopher.black	70
iclients popping up in the Fediverse I feel like I should probably		gopher.black	70
ispend the time to figure out what it is everyone is talking about		gopher.black	70
iwhen they use the word Federated.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSince we're talking definitions here, I figured I should start by		gopher.black	70
itelneting to my happy dictionary [0] that I described in an old		gopher.black	70
iphlog post [1]. Then I ran my query: "define english federation".		gopher.black	70
iHere's what popped out:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  <security> The establishment of some or all of business		gopher.black	70
i  agreements, {cryptographic} trust and user identifiers or		gopher.black	70
i  attributes across security and policy domains to enable more		gopher.black	70
i  seamless business interaction.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  As {web services} promise to enable integration between		gopher.black	70
i  business partners through {loose coupling} at the application		gopher.black	70
i  and messaging layer, federation does so at the identity		gopher.black	70
i  management layer, insulating each domain from the details of		gopher.black	70
i  the others' authentication and authorization.  Key to this		gopher.black	70
i  loose coupling at the identity management layer are		gopher.black	70
i  standardized mechanisms and formats for the communication of		gopher.black	70
i  identity information between the domains.  {SAML} is one such		gopher.black	70
i  standard.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFrom the sound of that definition, gopher is already federated in		gopher.black	70
ithat identity information between domains is inherent to the		gopher.black	70
iprotocol because it's irrelevant. There's no authorized use		gopher.black	70
imechanism here and the act of hosting content on a server is		gopher.black	70
ienough to identify the source. Since I host on gopher.black, if		gopher.black	70
iyour use of gopher queries my server you have used standard		gopher.black	70
imechanisms and formats for the communication of that information		gopher.black	70
ibetween the domains, right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMaybe the reason I'm having such difficulty is because my only		gopher.black	70
iexposure to federation as an idea has been via things like		gopher.black	70
iMastodon which have far more interoperable parts. Content from one		gopher.black	70
iindependent system is consumed and becomes content within another		gopher.black	70
ione, and the source of that content, the author, server, etc, all		gopher.black	70
ineed to be accounted for in the communication. That requires more		gopher.black	70
ithan gopher for sure.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEven so, I'm not satisfied. I think there's more to federation		gopher.black	70
ithan that definition. The context in how people discuss it seems		gopher.black	70
ito imply something else, but I can't put my finger on exactly what		gopher.black	70
ithat might be. Distributed systems like IPFS come up a lot in		gopher.black	70
ithose discussions, but I don't see a black & white relationship.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI guess my slow brainmeats can't get past the idea that federation		gopher.black	70
imeans I control my shiz but it can interact with everyone elses		gopher.black	70
ishiz in the same way. Am I so far off? Let me know with a reply or		gopher.black	70
iemail or mastodon or a hand written letter.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYes! Hand written letters are my absolute favorite. They		gopher.black	70
idemonstrate all that extra effort, they're physical treasures, and		gopher.black	70
iI get to silently judge your personality through bullshit		gopher.black	70
ihandwriting interpretation that I make up on the spot. Everyone		gopher.black	70
iwins! Send me an note with a reference to a pgp key and I'll send		gopher.black	70
iyou back my mailing address on the down-low.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCheers, fedi-gophers		gopher.black	70
