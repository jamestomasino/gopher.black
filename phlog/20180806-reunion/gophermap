iThis past weekend I went to the Tomasino family reunion in Ohio.		gopher.black	70
iIt was good to see my sister and her family, and to run into all		gopher.black	70
ithe other relatives that I haven't seen since I was my son's age.		gopher.black	70
iIt was nice for him to experience a reunion as well. He doesn't		gopher.black	70
isee anyone but my wife and I most of the time since we don't live		gopher.black	70
inear any of our family and soon will be moving much further away.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI like to say that my sister inherited all the roots and I got all		gopher.black	70
ithe wanderlust. My parents and their parents all grew up in		gopher.black	70
iYoungstown, Ohio, where our immegrant ancestors all settled. They		gopher.black	70
iwere fruitful and multiplied and most of the brood has remained		gopher.black	70
ifairly close to that nexus. When my parents married they moved		gopher.black	70
iaway chasing work leading to my sister and I being born in		gopher.black	70
iVirginia. We lived there briefly and then a few years in Maryland		gopher.black	70
ibefore heading to New Jersey where we both completed high school.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat was enough for my Sister. She went to college back in		gopher.black	70
iYoungstown and never left again. All the years growing up she		gopher.black	70
italked about going "back" and she didn't hesitate. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI took the other approach. Growing up away from extended family,		gopher.black	70
iI learned to love the move. After high school I did a brief stint		gopher.black	70
iin college before joining the Navy. I moved a lot in the service,		gopher.black	70
iand then a lot more afterwards. After college #2 and grad school,		gopher.black	70
ithe moves continued. I've managed to live in 15 states now, and		gopher.black	70
iI'm thrilled to get out of the United States finally.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOn the one hand, I think I can thank my sister for my own freedom		gopher.black	70
iof place. She is an anchor in the family that allows me to float		gopher.black	70
ifree. While we were in Ohio I spent a few days in her company		gopher.black	70
iwandering Youngstown, Austintown, Struthers, and Lowellville. In		gopher.black	70
ievery single place we stopped, be it restaurant or school or		gopher.black	70
igrocery or playground, we met someone that knew her well enough to		gopher.black	70
istop by and talk. She is so entwined with the place it is a part		gopher.black	70
iof her and she of it. My brother-in-law functions in the same way.		gopher.black	70
iHis family owns so much local farm-land and have roots so far back		gopher.black	70
iit doesn't make sense. He is an engineer who built this or that as		gopher.black	70
iwe drove around, and who coaches this team and that team, or		gopher.black	70
ihelped review the building plans for this guy's daughter's shop.		gopher.black	70
iIt's a fascinating life they have, and I'm so happy they get to		gopher.black	70
ihave it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat sort of thing may not appeal to me personally but I can see		gopher.black	70
ithe glamour in it and the comfort it can provide. I have no		gopher.black	70
iargument against it. It's just not for everyone.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iShe and my brother-in-law talk about how exciting it will be for		gopher.black	70
imy family to go abroad, but how they could never do it. I see why,		gopher.black	70
iand it isn't sad at all. We have chosen vastly different paths and		gopher.black	70
iboth are thrilling in their own way.		gopher.black	70

iAt the reunion itself we had a few fun surprises:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i - My neice found out her science partner in school last year was		gopher.black	70
i   actually her long lost cousin. If I have my math right, they're		gopher.black	70
i   4th cousin's once removed, but it is a little tricky...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i - My great, great grandfather was married twice. The daughter		gopher.black	70
i   from his first marriage married the brother of his second wife.		gopher.black	70
i   Go ahead and unpack that a little while. I'll wait.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i - My cousin is the production manager for Hamilton on Broadway!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i - My 98 year old grandpa has been listening to the same GE radio		gopher.black	70
i   for 50 years. It still works perfectly. Ridiculous.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i - I'm related to pretty much the entire town of Lowellville,		gopher.black	70
i   Ohio. Here's a video from the 30s and 40s of the town		gopher.black	70
i   celebrating a wedding in the 30s and the Feast of Our Lady of		gopher.black	70
i   Mt Carmel (July 16th, 1946)[0]. I watched this with my grandpa		gopher.black	70
i   and he named pretty much everyone in here at a glance. The guy		gopher.black	70
i   with the suave hair at 13:13 is my great uncle, my grandpa's		gopher.black	70
i   brother. He was a funny guy.		gopher.black	70
