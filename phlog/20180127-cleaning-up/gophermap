 Cleaning up
 January 27th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I spent the day organizing my spaces, real and virtual. I needed
 to make a dedicated space for the SGI Indigo2, and that involved
 rearranging both of my desks in the office. That in turn meant
 moving a lot of things back downstairs to other places in the
 house. This set off a chain of cleaning that ended with me
 rearranging medicine cabinets, under sinks, and even a bit of sock
 drawer.
 
 Things feel better now. My spaces are tidy and my mental state
 reflects this.
