iCleaning up
iJanuary 27th, 2018

iI spent the day organizing my spaces, real and virtual. I needed
ito make a dedicated space for the SGI Indigo2, and that involved
irearranging both of my desks in the office. That in turn meant
imoving a lot of things back downstairs to other places in the
ihouse. This set off a chain of cleaning that ended with me
irearranging medicine cabinets, under sinks, and even a bit of sock
idrawer.

iThings feel better now. My spaces are tidy and my mental state
ireflects this.
