iHow do you read my phlog with VF-1? I've got it installed here and	
ihave used it a few times and I generally like it. When I point it	
iat my own gopher hole I have trouble reading stuff. I write long	
igophermaps, but not with lots of links in them. What do you do to	
iread it? Do you scroll back with tmux or something? I'm curious!
