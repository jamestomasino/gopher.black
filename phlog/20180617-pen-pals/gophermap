iI was looking into some leadership and management training stuff		gopher.black	70
irecently [0] and it's been really helping me make progress as		gopher.black	70
ia team leader. There's plenty you can learn on-the-job, but it's		gopher.black	70
ihelpful to get good advice from a trusted source.		gopher.black	70

iWhile looking at content on engagement I ran across a really		gopher.black	70
ienlightening piece of information. People tend to value praise		gopher.black	70
ibased on the effort put in to giving it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAt my current company we've gone through a lot of different		gopher.black	70
isystems for calling out exceptional work. We've had some official		gopher.black	70
ithings, some local office things, manager made-up things, and		gopher.black	70
ithey've had wildly different reactions. Our current system is		gopher.black	70
ia corporate level point system with a rewards site where you can		gopher.black	70
ilog-in and pick out items you want with your accrued points. It		gopher.black	70
iis, almost universally, ignored. It means nothing to individuals		gopher.black	70
igetting points. There's no real public system for acknowledging		gopher.black	70
ipeers. It's pretty much useless.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iContrast that with our most successful system: an oversized		gopher.black	70
ipost-card that had some award blurb stuff up top and a big open		gopher.black	70
itext area underneath where a manager would hand-write what you did		gopher.black	70
ito make a difference. They were peer nominated and manager		gopher.black	70
iapproved. We announced them at "town hall" meetings so everyone		gopher.black	70
iwould hear about your awesomeness as it was read out. There was		gopher.black	70
ia small financial award with it, but it was secondary. People kept		gopher.black	70
ithose things and put them up on their desks.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis all brought me back to an on-again-off-again conversation		gopher.black	70
ithread that floats around gopherspace: comments. I love when you		gopher.black	70
iguys and gals send me an email about something I wrote, or post		gopher.black	70
ia reply or acknowledgement in your own phlog. It means so much to		gopher.black	70
ime because you put in the effort. It wasn't a drive by "like"		gopher.black	70
ibutton. In managerial terms you didn't just give me a nod and say,		gopher.black	70
i"nice work," you took time out of your day to write me a note.		gopher.black	70
iThat's awesome.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt also makes my mind wander the path to hand-written letters. I'm		gopher.black	70
ian infrequent letter writer, but when I write or receive one it's		gopher.black	70
ialways special. I have a bag in my office of every hand-written		gopher.black	70
iletter I've ever gotten.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy handwriting isn't great. I don't always have brilliant things		gopher.black	70
ito say in a letter. Honestly, the content isn't all that much		gopher.black	70
idifferent from an email, except I know it will take some time to		gopher.black	70
ireach the person and responding is more difficult. I try to say		gopher.black	70
ithings more completely. I invest more time and energy into it.		gopher.black	70
iI have to buy a stamp, after all.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'd like to write some letters again. Any of you up for it? My		gopher.black	70
icontact info is in my About page [1] including encryption options		gopher.black	70
iif you feel like sending me an address or PO box.		gopher.black	70
