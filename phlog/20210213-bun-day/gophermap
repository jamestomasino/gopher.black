iMonday is Bun Day here in Iceland. Bollur, the buns of the day,		gopher.black	70
iare sort of like cream puffs. Folks get jams and whipped cream and		gopher.black	70
imix them together and stuff the buns to overflowing, then smother		gopher.black	70
ithem in chocolate sauce. It's a healthy time!		gopher.black	70

iThere's also a super-duper Icelandic tradition with bun day that		gopher.black	70
imany parents choose to not teach their kids. Early on Monday		gopher.black	70
imorning children in the know will wake up early, sneak into their		gopher.black	70
iparents' bedroom and WHACK WHACK WHACK them in their bed with		gopher.black	70
isticks! However many whacks they get in before the parents get up		gopher.black	70
iis how many buns they get. Lovely!		gopher.black	70

iFollowing Bun Day is a sort of Fat Tuesday-like holiday that		gopher.black	70
iinvolves gorging yourself on all sorts of special foods that are		gopher.black	70
iterrible for you. I forget the name of that one, but it's nice		gopher.black	70
itoo. 		gopher.black	70

iFinally we get to Ash Wednesday. Here in Iceland Ash Wednesday is		gopher.black	70
ithe costume & candy holiday. Halloween is a relatively recent		gopher.black	70
iphenomenon here and not very popular mostly because they already		gopher.black	70
ihave most of those traditions at the start of lent. Kids dress up		gopher.black	70
iin all sorts of costumes, go to school that way, and then later go		gopher.black	70
iaround begging for candy. But here they don't go to individual		gopher.black	70
ihomes and say "trick or treat". Instead they go to businesses and		gopher.black	70
ising songs for their treats! If you head downtown to Reykjavik on		gopher.black	70
iWednesday you'll see this in full swing. It's really cute and so		gopher.black	70
istrange to see bank-branded popcorn bags and the like.		gopher.black	70

iNeedless to say the next 3 days are pretty much party-time for the		gopher.black	70
ikids. No school work will get done and that's a joy in itself.		gopher.black	70
iEveryone is going to be on a crazy sugar rush. Good for them. :)		gopher.black	70
