iIt is an openbsd 6.4 system that will be focused on activities		gopher.black	70
iaround privacy, anonymity, and security. To be clear, this is not		gopher.black	70
ia system for black-hat hacking (whether targeted at tilde.black or		gopher.black	70
ioutward), but rather for discussion and testing of ideas that		gopher.black	70
ipromote smart behaviors around privacy online. I hope we will		gopher.black	70
icreate some well-reviewed guides in the near future.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you want to join tilde.black, send me an ssh pubkey and an		gopher.black	70
iemail address to receive your welcome email. If you want to remain		gopher.black	70
ianonymous on the system, you can use a disposable email address,		gopher.black	70
iand you can connect to the server via ssh over tor [0].		gopher.black	70

iAdditionally, users on tilde.black don't get to choose a username.		gopher.black	70
iInstead you are assigned 10 of the 10,000 usernames that have been		gopher.black	70
ipregenerated from a wordlist on the system. You can log in to any		gopher.black	70
ior all of them. They're all full users with all access rights. You		gopher.black	70
ican swap between them in the forums (not live yet) or send email		gopher.black	70
iamongst yourself. If you connect to the server over tor nobody		gopher.black	70
iwill know the difference!		gopher.black	70

iIn case you're curious, openbsd doesn't seem to have any noticable		gopher.black	70
islowdown with 10,000 user accounts. That's pretty cool!		gopher.black	70
