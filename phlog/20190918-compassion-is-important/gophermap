iI started this phost intending to say something about RMS [0] and		gopher.black	70

iThe thing is, nobody really cares about "yet another opinion".		gopher.black	70
iIt's just another example of how comments are useless [1].		gopher.black	70

iInstead I think I'll say something about compassion.		gopher.black	70

iRight now people are suffering. Richard Stallman is watching in		gopher.black	70
ishock, outrage, and yes, in pain, as the world he built around		gopher.black	70
ihimself falls apart. He is suffering.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAlso, the dozens of individuals he has interacted with over the		gopher.black	70
iyears who have been the targets of his well-meaning pedantry, of		gopher.black	70
ihis priviliged musings, and of his "hot takes", are feeling the		gopher.black	70
ipainful effects of those encounters. They feel demeaned,		gopher.black	70
iless-than, or ignored. They feel injured, helpless, outraged, and		gopher.black	70
iyes, in pain. They are suffering.		gopher.black	70

iEpstein's victims have suffered horrendously and suffer still as		gopher.black	70
ithe government closes their options for compensation in the wake		gopher.black	70
iof his suicide.		gopher.black	70

iIn short, there's a whole lot of pain going around and we'd all be		gopher.black	70
ia little bit better people if we took a moment to consider it		gopher.black	70
ibefore we launch into our next diatribe. That's not to say you		gopher.black	70
ishould shut up. Just try not to forget there's humans on the other		gopher.black	70
iside of your outrage.		gopher.black	70
