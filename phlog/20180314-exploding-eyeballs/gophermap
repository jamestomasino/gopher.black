iMy eyes started causing me issues in November. I was driving home	
iafter work and the lights of the cars seemed cranked up to 11.	
iThere were halos and pulses on everything. My short drive home	
ileft me squinting and tearing up. By January, I couldn't continue	
ilooking at my computer screen after 4pm. I needed longer and	
ilonger breaks in order to recouperate. 	
i	
iI saw an eye doctor in February and got checked out. "It's good	
inews and bad news," she said. "The good news is your eyes are	
iperfectly healthy. There are no signs of glaucoma or cataracts,	
ithe retinas are healthy. Everything looks good." I nodded. "That's	
ialso the bad news. You shouldn't be having these issues."	
i	
iIn the end, she recommended I get special glasses with amber tints	
ito block the blue light. My first pair arrived yesterday.	
i	
iIt's about 8pm now and I've been looking at screens all day. Just	
inow my eyes are starting to dry up and feel tired. I think that's	
imore acceptible than the 4pm thing. Still, I wish it wouldn't	
ihappen at all.
