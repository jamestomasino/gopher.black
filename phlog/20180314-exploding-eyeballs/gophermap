iMy eyes started causing me issues in November. I was driving home		gopher.black	70
iafter work and the lights of the cars seemed cranked up to 11.		gopher.black	70
iThere were halos and pulses on everything. My short drive home		gopher.black	70
ileft me squinting and tearing up. By January, I couldn't continue		gopher.black	70
ilooking at my computer screen after 4pm. I needed longer and		gopher.black	70
ilonger breaks in order to recouperate. 		gopher.black	70

iI saw an eye doctor in February and got checked out. "It's good		gopher.black	70
inews and bad news," she said. "The good news is your eyes are		gopher.black	70
iperfectly healthy. There are no signs of glaucoma or cataracts,		gopher.black	70
ithe retinas are healthy. Everything looks good." I nodded. "That's		gopher.black	70
ialso the bad news. You shouldn't be having these issues."		gopher.black	70

iIn the end, she recommended I get special glasses with amber tints		gopher.black	70
ito block the blue light. My first pair arrived yesterday.		gopher.black	70

iIt's about 8pm now and I've been looking at screens all day. Just		gopher.black	70
inow my eyes are starting to dry up and feel tired. I think that's		gopher.black	70
imore acceptible than the 4pm thing. Still, I wish it wouldn't		gopher.black	70
ihappen at all.		gopher.black	70
