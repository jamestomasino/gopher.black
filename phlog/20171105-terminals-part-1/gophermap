iTerminals, Part 1

iI've been using konsole for my terminal for a while, mainly
ibecause I was a KDE user and it came with it. I really like that
iit supports the ligatures that are in my font of choice, Firacode.
iI also like that it supports all the colors I want, and
iI customized that scheme really well. Beyond that, I don't like
ithat it's part of a window manager i don't use anymore. I don't
ilike the amount of resources it pulls in. I don't like that
iI can't change the settings anymore because I hid the menu and
ican't remember how to un-hide it (it should be a dotfile!).
i
iSo, I've been trying to go to xterm instead. Woo. As of tonight
iI got my xresources file working well enough that my fonts are at
ithe right size and my color scheme is solid. I have been having
ia hell of a time getting unicode characters to display properly,
ithough. After lots of reading, I think I know the problem: I can't
ifigure out how to format my firacode fontName line to include the
icharacter encoding. I changed it to -misc-fixed-... and it's
icoming out right. I thought I could use xfontsel to figure it out,
ibut I guess that only works with bitmap fonts, or maybe I don't
iknow what I'm doing. xlsfonts gives me a nice list, but only for
isystem fonts (I think) not those in a ~/.fonts folder.
i
iNext steps: get firacode working with unicode in xterm or uxterm.
iThen, double check that tmux copypasta still works like it should.
iFinally, get copy & paste working over SSH/mosh.
i
iAny advice from the peanut gallery?
