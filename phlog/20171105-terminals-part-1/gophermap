 Terminals, Part 1
 November 05th, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I've been using konsole for my terminal for a while, mainly
 because I was a KDE user and it came with it. I really like that
 it supports the ligatures that are in my font of choice, Firacode.
 I also like that it supports all the colors I want, and
 I customized that scheme really well. Beyond that, I don't like
 that it's part of a window manager i don't use anymore. I don't
 like the amount of resources it pulls in. I don't like that
 I can't change the settings anymore because I hid the menu and
 can't remember how to un-hide it (it should be a dotfile!).
 
 So, I've been trying to go to xterm instead. Woo. As of tonight
 I got my xresources file working well enough that my fonts are at
 the right size and my color scheme is solid. I have been having
 a hell of a time getting unicode characters to display properly,
 though. After lots of reading, I think I know the problem: I can't
 figure out how to format my firacode fontName line to include the
 character encoding. I changed it to -misc-fixed-... and it's
 coming out right. I thought I could use xfontsel to figure it out,
 but I guess that only works with bitmap fonts, or maybe I don't
 know what I'm doing. xlsfonts gives me a nice list, but only for
 system fonts (I think) not those in a ~/.fonts folder.
 
 Next steps: get firacode working with unicode in xterm or uxterm.
 Then, double check that tmux copypasta still works like it should.
 Finally, get copy & paste working over SSH/mosh.
 
 Any advice from the peanut gallery?
