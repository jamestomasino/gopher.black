i1. How far in advance do you like to start planning things?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is quite variable. Speeches and presentations that don't		gopher.black	70
irequire slides? Those I prefer to work on very briefly before		gopher.black	70
iI have to perform. The over-prep and dwelling on it increases my		gopher.black	70
istress and doesn't make the delivery any better. But if I'm		gopher.black	70
iprepping a larger project or something that requires lots of		gopher.black	70
ipre-work, steps, 3rd parties, etc, then I try to get that done and		gopher.black	70
iout of the way as early as possible. For instance, my trip to		gopher.black	70
ivisit family in the states next year is already arranged and		gopher.black	70
ieverything booked except the plane tickets (since prices are time		gopher.black	70
idependent).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. What do you hope happens in 2022?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI would really love it if the vaccination levels across the globe		gopher.black	70
ihelp us bring COVID to a long-term managable level that doesn't		gopher.black	70
iresult in waves of hospitalizations and deaths. The cascading		gopher.black	70
ieffects of that would be huge and wonderful. I also hope 2022		gopher.black	70
ibrings some nice moments with the family. The kid is at a great		gopher.black	70
iage right now and I'm really enjoying all the time we get to spend		gopher.black	70
itogether.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. What challenges have you recently overcome?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHmm, I'm not sure. I've been fighting a sleep disorder recently		gopher.black	70
iand while it's not quite overcome, it's very close. I hope that		gopher.black	70
iwraps up soon.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i4. Seasonal traditions you're most excited about		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm a big christmas music fan and listen to it year round, but		gopher.black	70
iespecially on repeat during this season. It brings be happy		gopher.black	70
imemories and sets a wonderful festive mood in the home. It reminds		gopher.black	70
ime not to work too hard and to spend time with the family.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe've adopted several Icelandic traditions and added them to our		gopher.black	70
iown family ones. We leave a shoe in the window for each of the		gopher.black	70
iYule Lads as they come to visit leading up to Christmas. They are		gopher.black	70
ithirteen trolls that visit one-a-night on the days leading up to		gopher.black	70
iChristmas Eve. Each has his own personality and will usually leave		gopher.black	70
ia little treat in your shoe if you've been good. If not, you might		gopher.black	70
ifind a rotten potato in there instead. Wit has a bit of a beef		gopher.black	70
iwith Door-Slammer, but they're making up. Last year he left Wit		gopher.black	70
ifake cat poop in his shoe.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat else? Hmm... We have our stockings and tree set up of course.		gopher.black	70
iI put the tree up and Leah and Wit do the decorating. Then I put		gopher.black	70
ithe star on top and it's all set. Presents slowly appear day by		gopher.black	70
iday leading up to the big day.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSanta is a big deal here still. Wit knows that the real Santa is		gopher.black	70
inot the guy he sees at the malls. We've explained that he lives in		gopher.black	70
iFinnish Lapland above the arctic circle, which is why people refer		gopher.black	70
ito his home as the North Pole. We've seen the videos of him at		gopher.black	70
ihome with his reindeer pulling the sleigh. We've also discussed		gopher.black	70
ihow different cultures celebrate on Christmas Eve vs Christmas		gopher.black	70
iday, meaning Santa has 2 full nights to travel the globe, plus		gopher.black	70
itime zones to take advantage of. With proper planning it's		gopher.black	70
ibasically 3 days of activity to get it all done, and only in		gopher.black	70
ipredominantely Christian areas. Not such a big deal as the stories		gopher.black	70
imake it seem. Wit also knows that Santa doesn't wrap his presents.		gopher.black	70
iHe leaves them loose by the tree.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFinally, we exchange books on christmas eve in the faux		gopher.black	70
ijólabókaflöð tradition. The term actually refers to the publishing		gopher.black	70
iindustry going cray-cray and releasing everything at once here for		gopher.black	70
ithe holiday rush, but somehow it got memed into this make-believe		gopher.black	70
istory about Icelandic Christmas Eve. In reality Icelanders open		gopher.black	70
itheir presents on Christmas Eve, not just books. Still, we liked		gopher.black	70
ithe idea of it and since we still open presents on Christmas day,		gopher.black	70
ithat lets us do the book & chocolate celebration the day before.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's one other tradition here where people all go out for a big		gopher.black	70
iChristmas feast. It's usually done via work, but there's family		gopher.black	70
igroups and friends groups that go out as well. Restaurants have		gopher.black	70
ia special menu for it and seats book up in August. Sadly we've not		gopher.black	70
ibeen able to try this yet as it's been shut down the last two		gopher.black	70
iyears due to COVID.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i5. Are you good at directions and maps?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYeah, pretty good. I've got a great direction sense in the wild		gopher.black	70
itoo, but I get turned around in cities.		gopher.black	70
