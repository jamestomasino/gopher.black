iI am a very active Audible user. I listen to a lot of audio books		gopher.black	70
iand Amazon's service has the best selection at the cheapest prices		gopher.black	70
iand offers the best players. I can listen on my phone or in the		gopher.black	70
ibrowser and stay in sync. I can open up a kindle and have the book		gopher.black	70
ipick up where the audio left off and vice-versa. This is some		gopher.black	70
islick stuff and it's my justification for sticking with a company		gopher.black	70
ithat represents a lot of things I despise.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere are some kinder looking alternative sources for the books		gopher.black	70
ipopping up around the net, but no one comes close to offering all		gopher.black	70
ithe things Audible does. That sucks because it reveals things		gopher.black	70
iabout me I don't like. I have chosen convenience over principals.		gopher.black	70
iI do it for my phone as well, which is a Pixel on Google Fi. Yuck.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI may not have it in me to be the ultimate champion of		gopher.black	70
istickin-it-to-the-man but I'd like to think I'm not a total		gopher.black	70
ipushover either. I'll get back at the giants with really		gopher.black	70
iuncomfortable sand in their shoes. Here's a few of the		gopher.black	70
iall-but-meaningless things I do to justify my lifestyle to myself.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. I have an Amazon credit card. It gives me 5% back on purchases		gopher.black	70
i   on Amazon.com and that's pretty much the only place I use it.		gopher.black	70
i   Here's the thing, once you get those points Amazon suggests you		gopher.black	70
i   redeem them on purchases. If you use your points on a purchase,		gopher.black	70
i   you don't EARN points on that purchase. If you did, that 5%		gopher.black	70
i   would really be 5.55555...%. Little bits matter, right? Well,		gopher.black	70
i   that credit card is offered through Chase. If you go to the		gopher.black	70
i   Chase website and redeem the points directly with them, you can		gopher.black	70
i   apply those points in the form of a statement credit. Aka, you		gopher.black	70
i   get that much money back, but it didn't in any way affect your		gopher.black	70
i   future purchases with Amazon. So, just to ensure I get that		gopher.black	70
i   extra 0.55555...% percent, when I'm about to make an Amazon		gopher.black	70
i   purchase and I have points available, I'll go to Chase and		gopher.black	70
i   redeem that many points off my bill as I make a normal purchase		gopher.black	70
i   on Amazon. Take THAT giant corporation! I'm squeezing whole		gopher.black	70
i   dollars off you!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. Audible books have stupid DRM on them. I don't care for that so		gopher.black	70
i   any books I get from them I immediately strip to mp3s and		gopher.black	70
i   back-up, just in case. Now and then I want to listen to		gopher.black	70
i   something without Amazon's help. Now I can just play an mp3		gopher.black	70
i   from the command-line. In fact, today I finally figured out		gopher.black	70
i   a viable method for resuming playback without having to		gopher.black	70
i   remember the timestamp.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   $ mpv --save-position-on-quit		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   It will resume where you left off when you quit. If you do it		gopher.black	70
i   on a directory it will remember where in the whole playlist you		gopher.black	70
i   left off. Really solid solve! It supports time-scale changes		gopher.black	70
i   too, so it's got everything you could want for playback. The		gopher.black	70
i   only lack is syncing between devices. Not quite viable to		gopher.black	70
i   replace Audible, but it's a piece of the puzzle.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI forget where I was going with this phlog. I like audio books and		gopher.black	70
imaybe one day I'll be able to cut out Amazon and Google		gopher.black	70
icompletely. Until then...		gopher.black	70
