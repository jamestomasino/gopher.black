iI just learned about youtube personality and musician, Poppy.		gopher.black	70
iThanks, brendantcc! Her music isn't bad, and the humor she		gopher.black	70
iobviously has with it makes it a pretty fun listen. The track "X"		gopher.black	70
iis my favorite so far with it's genre defying silliness. The rest		gopher.black	70
iof this (apparently 2nd) album seems a bit more like generic club		gopher.black	70
istuff, but still catchy.		gopher.black	70

iUnfortunately for Poppy, I just grabbed the latest (and last)		gopher.black	70
iCranberries album "In The End". It fills that Cranberries shaped		gopher.black	70
ihole in my heart perfectly. If you're a fan or still reeling from		gopher.black	70
ithe loss of Dolores O'Riordan then have no fear in picking it up.		gopher.black	70
iSolid stuff. I'll be listening to this on repeat for a while.		gopher.black	70
iMaybe Poppy will still be a thing when I dig back out.		gopher.black	70
