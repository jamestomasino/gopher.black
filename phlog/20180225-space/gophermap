iThis weekend I revamped my home-office/hobby spaces with my wife.
iWe have two main rooms we use for those types of things: the
ioffice and the "pink" room. The office is larger and has our TV
i(wall-mount job) both of our desktops, a couch, bookshelf, and
iassorted crap. The pink room, so called because the carpet is
ipink, holds a metric butt-ton of yarn, my sewing machine station,
iand a closet full of assorted crap.
i
iI decided I needed more workspace in the pink room to actually do
ianything with the sewing machine, so I offered to move one of my
ibig tables into there and move my wife's yarn into the office.
iThat set off a chain of moving things until I basically took over
ithe pink room and she took over the office. The only exception is
imy desktop, which powers the TV, has remained in the office.
iI have my laptop (this linux box I'm typing on right now) in the
ipink room set up with my electronics station!
i
iThe move of stuff sparked a purge of old crap including all our
iCDs and DVDs, about 12 bags of various sizes from luggage to an
iold hiking backpack, my Nintendo Power magazines, all my collected
icards (baseball mostly), my dad's collection of Harvard & National
iLampoon magazines. The list keeps going.
i
iThe space feels great. I've got room for sewing, electronics,
imusic (playing instruments), and my spinning wheel. It's a great
ifeeling.
