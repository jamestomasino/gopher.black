 This weekend I revamped my home-office/hobby spaces with my wife.
 We have two main rooms we use for those types of things: the
 office and the "pink" room. The office is larger and has our TV
 (wall-mount job) both of our desktops, a couch, bookshelf, and
 assorted crap. The pink room, so called because the carpet is
 pink, holds a metric butt-ton of yarn, my sewing machine station,
 and a closet full of assorted crap.
 
 I decided I needed more workspace in the pink room to actually do
 anything with the sewing machine, so I offered to move one of my
 big tables into there and move my wife's yarn into the office.
 That set off a chain of moving things until I basically took over
 the pink room and she took over the office. The only exception is
 my desktop, which powers the TV, has remained in the office.
 I have my laptop (this linux box I'm typing on right now) in the
 pink room set up with my electronics station!
 
 The move of stuff sparked a purge of old crap including all our
 CDs and DVDs, about 12 bags of various sizes from luggage to an
 old hiking backpack, my Nintendo Power magazines, all my collected
 cards (baseball mostly), my dad's collection of Harvard & National
 Lampoon magazines. The list keeps going.
 
 The space feels great. I've got room for sewing, electronics,
 music (playing instruments), and my spinning wheel. It's a great
 feeling.
