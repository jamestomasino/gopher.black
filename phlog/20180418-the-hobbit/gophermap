iI just hit one of the coolest dad milestones. I'm reading The	
iHobbit to my son. He's five, nearly six, and I've been talking it	
iup for the last couple days to get him excited. Tonight, he agreed	
ito listen to one page.	
i	
i"If you like it," I said, "I can read a little more. If not, we	
ican read this other book tonight and try again later."	
i	
iHe agreed. He lifted a stuffed dragon to his chest and nestled	
iinto a spot at my hip against his pillow. I looked down and he	
ilooked back up.	
i	
iA deep breath.	
i	
i"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."	
i	
iHe didn't want to stop at one.
