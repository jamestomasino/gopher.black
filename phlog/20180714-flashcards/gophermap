iUser jakob phlogged recently [0] about getting back into flash		gopher.black	70
icards & spaced repetition. He found a fantastic solution using		gopher.black	70
iemacs as he seems to be slowly adopting the "all things are emacs"		gopher.black	70
iprinciple. I'm not quite to that extreme with vim, but I do love		gopher.black	70
ime some command line solutions.		gopher.black	70

iPlain text is just simpler. I don't need fancy guis for 99% of my		gopher.black	70
istuff. Flash cards are definitely in that list. So, what's a man		gopher.black	70
ito do? Obviously the only solution is to roll my own!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI started by searching a bit on the different styles of spaced		gopher.black	70
irepetition (there are many) and quickly settled on the Leitner		gopher.black	70
iSystem. It's usable by hand, so I should clearly be able to		gopher.black	70
ireplicate it with a program, right? It turns out that there's not		gopher.black	70
ireally any agreement on the specifics of the system. I watched		gopher.black	70
iseveral videos on youtube who would almost get there and then say		gopher.black	70
isomething that didn't make any sense. The wikipedia page is such		gopher.black	70
ia hot mess I'm not even going to link you there. If you want to		gopher.black	70
iread some train wreck stuff, you'll need to go there on your own.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the end I settled on the following as my interpretation of		gopher.black	70
iLeitner:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Flash cards get a front and a back		gopher.black	70
i- Flash cards are sorted into levels based on your proficiency		gopher.black	70
i  with the card		gopher.black	70
i- All cards start at level 1		gopher.black	70
i- Cards move up one level when you successfully identify the back		gopher.black	70
i- Cards return all the way to level 1 if you fail to successfully		gopher.black	70
i  identify the back in time		gopher.black	70
i- Time is important. Sitting there staring at a card and working		gopher.black	70
i  it out is not the same as "getting it right". That is a failure.		gopher.black	70
i- The number of proficiency levels you use isn't important		gopher.black	70
i- The frequency of cards being shown is determined by the level:		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 1 are shown every day		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 2 are shown every other day		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 3 are shown every 3rd day		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 4 are shown every 4th day		gopher.black	70
i  - and so on		gopher.black	70
i- Cards are reviewed only once per session with the exception of		gopher.black	70
i  cards at level 1. They can be reviewed multiple times until they		gopher.black	70
i  move to level 2.		gopher.black	70

iI started putting together these notes yesterday into a README		gopher.black	70
ifile intending to build a bourne shell app like I did with burrow.		gopher.black	70
iI was reminded by a coworker that I said I'd build something in		gopher.black	70
inode soon, so I caved and used javascript instead. Yes, I felt		gopher.black	70
iincredibly dirty the whole time. Even worse, it was really, really		gopher.black	70
ifun and easy. Puke.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you have node installed you can try out my app by running:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  yarn global add flashleit		gopher.black	70
i  or		gopher.black	70
i  npm i -g flashleit		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's right.... Flashleit! Get it? Leitner... Flash Cards...		gopher.black	70
iHuzzah!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen you run the app you can start by adding cards. There's a menu		gopher.black	70
ioption for it. Cards creation will launch your $EDITOR. Card		gopher.black	70
ifronts & backs can be multi-line. Ascii art welcome!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou can also mess with some of the settings in the app. Change		gopher.black	70
isome colors, change the maximum proficiency level, or the delay		gopher.black	70
ibefore the card flip happens. There's more color settings in the		gopher.black	70
iconfiguration file if you want to go digging. It's usually at:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  ~/.config/config/configstore/flashleit.json		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
ibut it may vary on your system. All the data is stored in that one		gopher.black	70
ifile, including your cards. If you want to import a list or		gopher.black	70
igenerate one, just look at the pattern in there and mess with the		gopher.black	70
iJSON itself. You're big kids.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSource is over on github [1]. If you try it out and have any		gopher.black	70
irecommendations or spot any bugs, leave me an issue there. 		gopher.black	70
