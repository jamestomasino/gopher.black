iWhen I was a child my dad recorded an eclectic collection of TV		gopher.black	70
imovies for me onto a very low quality VHS. I'm fairly convinced he		gopher.black	70
ihad no idea what the stories were about but they probably said		gopher.black	70
ithey were for kids and that was good enough for him. For me, it		gopher.black	70
iwas a warm blanket of comfort. I adored every single thing on that		gopher.black	70
itape and watched them over and over. My sister, three years older		gopher.black	70
ithan me, couldn't stand any of them and would leave me alone.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYears later the VHS tape surfaced when I was in college. My friend		gopher.black	70
iand roomate at the time looked at this odd assortment of titles		gopher.black	70
iwritten on masking tape and asked about it. "Hold onto your butt!"		gopher.black	70
iI probably yelled and looked all over creation for a VCR.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe sat there, two guys in their twenties, watching this mad		gopher.black	70
icollection of cinematic excellence and I'll never forget his		gopher.black	70
ireaction.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"This tape explains ALL of you."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo what was on it? Allow me to give you the highlights:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt opened with a powerhouse. One of the most beautiful and		gopher.black	70
iheart-wrenching stories ever. Ray Bradbury's "All Summer in		gopher.black	70
ia Day".		gopher.black	70

iIf you've never seen or read the story, I can't tell you honestly		gopher.black	70
iwhich to look at first. The short story is powerful, but the video		gopher.black	70
ireally nails the drama. The only downside, which I did not		gopher.black	70
iremember from childhood, is the absolutely horrible score.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs an interesting side-note, I ended up ripping the video of my		gopher.black	70
iVHS tape and creating a chapterized DVD from it. I made fake		gopher.black	70
iartwork for the case and printed 5 copies. A friend working at the		gopher.black	70
iFranklin Indiana Public Library tagged them and snuck them onto		gopher.black	70
ithe shelves there. If anyone is in the Franklin Indiana area, have		gopher.black	70
ia look and see if you can find a copy!		gopher.black	70

i**** SPOILERS ****		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis story profoundly affected my own appreciation for sorrow and		gopher.black	70
itragedy. This was just strong enough for the child I was to feel		gopher.black	70
iit deeply and empathise with Margot. I was in the closet with her		gopher.black	70
iin darkness. It's hard to put into words what that did to me.		gopher.black	70

iThe next video on the tap was a TV adaptation of the 1977		gopher.black	70
ichildren's book by Daniel and Jill Pinkwater: The Hoboken Chicken		gopher.black	70
iEmergency. The plot as described on Wikipedia:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    The main character, Arthur, is asked to pick up a reserved		gopher.black	70
i    turkey for Thanksgiving dinner, but the market has lost the		gopher.black	70
i    reservation, and no store in the area has any turkeys or other		gopher.black	70
i    birds available for purchase. So Arthur finds and brings home		gopher.black	70
i    a 266-pound chicken named Henrietta. The family welcomes her		gopher.black	70
i    with open arms, but the neighbors are not so sure. Everyone in		gopher.black	70
i    town is horrified after Henrietta escapes.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs you can imagine, it's pure ridiculousness. The video format,		gopher.black	70
imade in the early 80s, is really bad. The giant chicken costume,		gopher.black	70
ithe acting, all of it. 		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iFollowing that was a harrowing tale of kidnapping and escape.		gopher.black	70
iThat's right, I'm talking about that oh-so-famous TV movie, 		gopher.black	70
iRun Rebecca Run! Synopsis:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    Simone Buchanan plays a young camera fanatic who is marooned		gopher.black	70
i    on a desert island. Here she is threatened by a refugee from		gopher.black	70
i    South America (Henri Szeps) who isn't keen on having his		gopher.black	70
i    whereabouts known. Hostility melts into friendship before the		gopher.black	70
i    rescue boats arrive.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's kind of a lame way of putting it. The dude is a fugitive		gopher.black	70
iand he decides to hold her captive so she can't give away his		gopher.black	70
ilocation. She tries to escape, and there's a bird, and stuff.		gopher.black	70
iI really wish I could explain it more, or link you to the actual		gopher.black	70
ivideo, but this one doesn't seem to be online at present. The best		gopher.black	70
iI can do is this trailer.		gopher.black	70

iI guess I could point to this one for some of my outdoors-y stuff,		gopher.black	70
ior maybe for my penchant for being a recluse and doing crimes. I		gopher.black	70
idunno.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd that brings us to the clean-up position on the tape. The #1		gopher.black	70
ibiggest hit for me was The Boy Who Loved Trolls, with its all-star		gopher.black	70
icast including Sam Waterston and William H. Macy, and the dad from		gopher.black	70
iAlf! This one is on Youtube in Parts and it's so worth your time:		gopher.black	70

iWhen the parents go away the secret magic of the world is revealed		gopher.black	70
ito a dreamy-eyed kid. He journeys on adventures, meets some crazy		gopher.black	70
icool characters (including a mermaid and a turtle!) and saves time		gopher.black	70
iitself. My fastination with the fantasy genre definitely comes		gopher.black	70
ifrom this thing, in all its flaws.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere were more things on the tape, but you get the idea. It was		gopher.black	70
ireally substantial to my emerging identity and I'm appreciative.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDo you have anything like that? Books, movies? A horrible drive		gopher.black	70
iyou took with the family every year that scarred you for life?		gopher.black	70
