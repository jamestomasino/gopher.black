iWhat if quantum entaglement and spooky action at a distance allow		gopher.black	70
ifor us to create extremely long range connections, but with very		gopher.black	70
ilow bandwidth. "Why would that be the case?" you might ask.		gopher.black	70
iFrankly, I have no idea. If you don't think about the details too		gopher.black	70
imuch it seems like something you could gloss over in a story,		gopher.black	70
ithough.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to explore that idea in a short story as a vehicle to		gopher.black	70
ireintroduce gopher as the web of the space-future. No nonsense,		gopher.black	70
itext driven communication across vast spaces would make for an		gopher.black	70
iincredible aesthetic and a great reason to draw some attention		gopher.black	70
iback to port 70.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think of films like Alien and their use of text for		gopher.black	70
icommunication and it makes sense to me. Local running AIs and		gopher.black	70
isuper-powerful UI crap is neat, but for anything at a distance we		gopher.black	70
ifall back on the age-old safety of text. If you imagine a universe		gopher.black	70
ipopulated by ships launched and traveling at relativistic speeds,		gopher.black	70
iwe quickly encounter vast distances in relative time, not only		gopher.black	70
ispace. These time gaps are a bigger threat to communication than		gopher.black	70
idistance. We cannot innovate because it leaves behind all those		gopher.black	70
ithat have gone out before. We cannot shift paradigms. We must		gopher.black	70
ispeak to a common level.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIsn't that a cool thought? I want to read stuff in that universe.		gopher.black	70
iI want gopher featured prominantly. I guess I should start working		gopher.black	70
ion it at some point.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDo any of you have any ideas to pile on top? I don't have a story		gopher.black	70
ihere at all, just setting, so I could use all the help I can get.		gopher.black	70
iOr, I guess if one of you is feeling the creative juices flowing,		gopher.black	70
itake it and run. I want to read it more than I want to write it.		gopher.black	70
