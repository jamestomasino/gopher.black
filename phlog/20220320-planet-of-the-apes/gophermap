iI just watched the new-ish Planet of the Apes trilogy with my son.		gopher.black	70
iHe loved them and so did I. I saw the second film a few years back		gopher.black	70
iand remember thinking it was just an incredible piece of		gopher.black	70
ifilmmaking. The cinematography was brilliant, as was the acting,		gopher.black	70
ipacing, and the classic betrayal story. Now that I've finally seen		gopher.black	70
ithe third I can say without reservation that it's one of the		gopher.black	70
ibetter trilogies of the 21st century. Matt Reeves contributions on		gopher.black	70
i2 and 3 are a marvel.		gopher.black	70

iIf you are interested in seeing it, try and find subtitles for the		gopher.black	70
iape-parts. It will help convey some of the depth of story.		gopher.black	70
iI watched subtitle-free the first time and while it's possible to		gopher.black	70
ifollow and enjoy, there's a distance that grows between you and		gopher.black	70
ithe apes.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAlso, there's something wonderfully cathartic about seeing these		gopher.black	70
ifilms and unreservedly rooting for the humans to all die already		gopher.black	70
iso the apes can inherit the Earth.		gopher.black	70
