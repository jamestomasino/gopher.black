gpg explorations
August 9th, 2017
----------------------------------------

When I started using unix systems in college I quickly realized that there
are some programs that are insanely useful but impossible to use. That
list included things like vim, sed, and awk. I saw the power users around
me fly through tasks and do the impossible because they knew the internals
so well. Regular expressions in searches are a game changer when you're
new to the game.

These days my technical mountain to climb is that of privacy and security,
and the tool I need to grok to get there is gpg. I can use things like
Kleopatra to manage my keys or Enigmail to sign, encode/decode emails, but
even simple command line tasks like verifying key signatures of Tails
distributions requires me to bust out a how-to guide. GPG is a core
program to key management and I cannot suffer myself to stay ignorant.

Starting today I'm adding another major item on my todo list: grok gpg
