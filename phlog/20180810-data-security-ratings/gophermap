iIt's very interesting stuff which started on Mastodon and		gopher.black	70
icontinued in gopherspace. It's worth a read.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI had one last thought I wanted to share based on an exchange on		gopher.black	70
iIRC. Some people have brought up threat levels and planning your		gopher.black	70
isecurity for the type of danger you really face, not ridiculous		gopher.black	70
ilevels of paranoia. We're not all Snowden, after-all. That being		gopher.black	70
isaid, I wanted to share my email system so you can see what		gopher.black	70
ihappens when you go off the deep end with no real reason.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFirst of all, I use neomailbox for my mail provider. They're		gopher.black	70
ipretty great, in a country with better data privacy laws than the		gopher.black	70
iUS, and have solid privacy policies and encryption measures in		gopher.black	70
iplace to protect their users. They offer a unique feature that		gopher.black	70
iI've not found in other providers: they will auto-sign incoming		gopher.black	70
imail with your public key if you request it. While mail that		gopher.black	70
iwasn't encrypted at the source may still be vulnerable in		gopher.black	70
itransmission, after it hits their servers its safety just took		gopher.black	70
ia major step up.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNext, I only connect to neomailbox over a VPN & Tor. Outgoing mail		gopher.black	70
irelayed through their servers wipes metadata anyway, but it's just		gopher.black	70
ianother stupid thing to do in protecting the connection itself.		gopher.black	70
iHow do I connect? Good old pop3, baby. I don't leave anything on		gopher.black	70
ithe server.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMail is fetched locally and the system auto-disconnects from the		gopher.black	70
iinternet. When browsing messages I remain offline. I reply and		gopher.black	70
iqueue up my outgoing mail. When ready to send, browsing shuts down		gopher.black	70
iand the machine reconnects safely to send it on its way.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe local maildir is backed up over spideroak, encrypting the		gopher.black	70
imailboxes of already encrypted messages offsite to another machine		gopher.black	70
iin case of calamity.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's it! Fun right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to reiterate, this is completely unnecessary for my threat		gopher.black	70
ilevel and it was done more as a hobby project to see how far		gopher.black	70
iI could push it. Airgapping, redundant encryption, it's too much		gopher.black	70
ifor people to bother with. It's a great illustration of why other		gopher.black	70
ipeople give up and just settle for whatever.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you're new to infosec, do yourself a favor and get a protonmail		gopher.black	70
iaccount. That's about as good as you're going to do without		gopher.black	70
iputting in a bunch of work. Is it as good as what Snowden does? Oh		gopher.black	70
ihells no. But you're not on the run from the US government, are		gopher.black	70
iyou? It'll keep google off your back, and you're less likely to		gopher.black	70
ifall victim to simple scams.		gopher.black	70
