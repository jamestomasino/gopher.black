iLeaving AWS	
iMarch 29th, 2018	
i----------------------------------------

iEarlier this week I got a notification from the AWS console that	
imy billing alarm level had been reached. I'm glad I set it because	
ithere's no other way I would have know that I was running up an	
iincredibly expensive bill.	
i	
iOver the weekend I was experimenting with Nextcloud and linked an	
iAWS S3 volume as an extra share. Something went wrong and the	
isyncs were failing, but constantly retrying to download data. At	
ileast, this is what I now believe is the root cause. At the time	
iI figured it was one of my public sites getting abused.	
i	
iI went digging around in AWS to see if I could figure out who the	
iculprit was, but that was in vain. AWS is a labyrinth of excessive	
ioverengineering, techno-babble, and the worlds worst	
idocumentation. I can find no information about where the charges	
iare coming from beyond "bandwidth".	
i	
iIt's 2 days later and my bill is over $300. I logged a support	
iticket asking Amazon what the hell is happening, but screw it. I'm	
idone. I don't need AWS shit, it was just the idea of fast	
iperformance that brought me there. My sites are all static.	
i	
iI unlocked my domains and I'm transferring them to Namesilo. I'll	
isave down some of the crap sitting in cold storage, re-clone my	
istatic sites on the gopher.black pi, add in nginx and tell my	
irouter to forward port 80.	
i	
iThe cloud can suck it.
