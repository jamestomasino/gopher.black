iEarlier this week I got a notification from the AWS console that		gopher.black	70
imy billing alarm level had been reached. I'm glad I set it because		gopher.black	70
ithere's no other way I would have know that I was running up an		gopher.black	70
iincredibly expensive bill.		gopher.black	70

iOver the weekend I was experimenting with Nextcloud and linked an		gopher.black	70
iAWS S3 volume as an extra share. Something went wrong and the		gopher.black	70
isyncs were failing, but constantly retrying to download data. At		gopher.black	70
ileast, this is what I now believe is the root cause. At the time		gopher.black	70
iI figured it was one of my public sites getting abused.		gopher.black	70

iI went digging around in AWS to see if I could figure out who the		gopher.black	70
iculprit was, but that was in vain. AWS is a labyrinth of excessive		gopher.black	70
ioverengineering, techno-babble, and the worlds worst		gopher.black	70
idocumentation. I can find no information about where the charges		gopher.black	70
iare coming from beyond "bandwidth".		gopher.black	70

iIt's 2 days later and my bill is over $300. I logged a support		gopher.black	70
iticket asking Amazon what the hell is happening, but screw it. I'm		gopher.black	70
idone. I don't need AWS shit, it was just the idea of fast		gopher.black	70
iperformance that brought me there. My sites are all static.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI unlocked my domains and I'm transferring them to Namesilo. I'll		gopher.black	70
isave down some of the crap sitting in cold storage, re-clone my		gopher.black	70
istatic sites on the gopher.black pi, add in nginx and tell my		gopher.black	70
irouter to forward port 80.		gopher.black	70
