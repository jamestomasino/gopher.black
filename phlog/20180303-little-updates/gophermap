 Little updates

 Welcome to a few new gopher folks on sdf: mre, ja, oms. We love
 you already.
 
 Yesterday we got nailed pretty hard by a storm and lost power for
 a day or so. We avoided property damage in general, which is
 awesome, but one of the big pines in our front yard is now at a 45
 degree angle and will probably have to come down. My basement is
 flooded and I slept poorly. All-in-all, it wasn't too bad.
 
 My son is old enough to know what's going on now, so this was his
 first substantial power outtage and he had plenty of questions. He
 learned a lot about electricity, and about ways to stay warm
 without fancy heating systems. Talking by candle light is a great
 way to spend time with the family.

 Today I spent a few hours updating my gopher hole helper utility,
 burrow [0]. I've had this lingering issue with how I'd constructed
 a few of the functions. One of the problems was actually giving me
 a linting error in shellcheck, and that I cannot abide.
 Regardless, I added a bunch of new functionality, made a ton of
 things configurable, updated releases, and put a Getting Started
 page up on the Github wiki. 
 
 If you don't have anything in place to manage your gopher hole and
 are not happy with doing everything manually, please give it
 a try. I'd love some feedback on the tool, my documentation, the
 guide, whatever. Bug me on Mastodon (tomasino@mastodon.sdf.org) or
 over on #gopher on irc.sdf.org. You can also find me a bunch of
 other ways if you look at the About [1] section on this gopher
 hole.
 
 Cheers!
