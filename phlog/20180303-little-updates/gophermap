iWelcome to a few new gopher folks on sdf: mre, ja, oms. We love
iyou already.
i
iYesterday we got nailed pretty hard by a storm and lost power for
ia day or so. We avoided property damage in general, which is
iawesome, but one of the big pines in our front yard is now at a 45
idegree angle and will probably have to come down. My basement is
iflooded and I slept poorly. All-in-all, it wasn't too bad.
i
iMy son is old enough to know what's going on now, so this was his
ifirst substantial power outtage and he had plenty of questions. He
ilearned a lot about electricity, and about ways to stay warm
iwithout fancy heating systems. Talking by candle light is a great
iway to spend time with the family.

iToday I spent a few hours updating my gopher hole helper utility,
iburrow [0]. I've had this lingering issue with how I'd constructed
ia few of the functions. One of the problems was actually giving me
ia linting error in shellcheck, and that I cannot abide.
iRegardless, I added a bunch of new functionality, made a ton of
ithings configurable, updated releases, and put a Getting Started
ipage up on the Github wiki. 
i
iIf you don't have anything in place to manage your gopher hole and
iare not happy with doing everything manually, please give it
ia try. I'd love some feedback on the tool, my documentation, the
iguide, whatever. Bug me on Mastodon (tomasino@mastodon.sdf.org) or
iover on #gopher on irc.sdf.org. You can also find me a bunch of
iother ways if you look at the About [1] section on this gopher
ihole.
i
iCheers!
