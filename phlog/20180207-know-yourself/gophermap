iI picked up a little box of cards called Know Yourself [0].
iThey're prompts for self-exploration or meditation. In all, there
iare 60 cards that ask you questions to help guide you to a more
ithorough understanding of self.
i
iI'm a nerd for a lot of things, many of which are technical.
iHardware hacking, obscure programming languages, weird Japanese
iflutes, you get the idea. Some of my nerdiness is geared toward
iphilosophy and religion, though. I have that Jesuit background, of
icourse, and a long history of reading and experimenting with other
ioptions than Catholocism. Through all that jazz I've collected
iideas just like I collect old machines. Meditation techniques are
imy aesthetic, as the kids say.
i
iAnyway, here's one card to whet your whistle:
i
i  Front:
i
i    In your worst fears, what might your colleagues at work be
i    criticising you for behind your back?
i
i  Rear:
i
i    There is no point being squeamish here. Your fears are
i    correct. Anything you might suspect others might think is
i    already a reality. The point isn't to escape such imagined
i    gossip but to take gracious measures to deal with its almost
i    certain existence.
i
iIt's an interesting card and it put my mind on a few things.
iI like to walk around and visit with people at work as a way of
itaking a break, stretching my legs and my mind. I'm sure it annoys
isome of the people in the office, though I don't think it's the
iones I visit. I'm sure there's people who have personal feelings
iagainst the way I handle situations, or whom I rub the wrong way.
iI don't always roll over and let people have their way, and that
ican be seen as combative or antagonistic at times.
i
iThese aren't new thoughts and they don't bother me. I've accepted
ithat my purpose in my career isn't to be liked by all people. It's
ito be effective, fulfilled as much as possible, to forge good
irelationships where possible, and to provide for my family. I'm
iokay with the rest as-is.
i
iThe other part that grabbed my attention was the bit on the
iflipside of the card. I like the directness it takes and even the
iway its worded. On the surface it seems like it's suggesting that
iyou find a way to fix or rectify the things at work which you may
ibe criticised for. Upon a closer look it carefully says only to
i"take gracious measures to deal with" the criticism.
i
iIn stoic terms, this is a fantastic approach because it's not
ifocused on fixing something which is beyond your control (i.e.,
imaking those around you like you), but instead with the elements
ithat are in your control (namely, your reactions). Think long and
ihard about the criticisms others may have and consider them. Are
ithey valid? If so, I may want to change something I do, or I may
ifeel that my choice is more important than their reaction to it.
iMaybe their criticism is invalid. Whichever situation may exist
ithe most important thing is to find peace with it and focus my
ienergy on only the things which are in my absolute control.
i
iI like these cards. Maybe I'll do a written response to another
ione some day.
