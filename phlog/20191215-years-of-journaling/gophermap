iA few of you brilliant gopherites have been talking about the		gopher.black	70
ilength of time they've been blogging [0,1]. 20 years is a lot of		gopher.black	70
iblog posts whether collected on the web or gopher. It's great to		gopher.black	70
isee collections like this all together surviving so long.		gopher.black	70

iI've had people go spelunking down into my own blog [2] archives		gopher.black	70
ibefore and I have to say it's a really cool feeling. Journaling is		gopher.black	70
iinherently about yourself. When another human decides to spend		gopher.black	70
itheir time reading your personal thoughts and history, it's very		gopher.black	70
iflattering (at least to me).		gopher.black	70

iThere are technical blogs aplenty which focus on code or math or		gopher.black	70
iscience or whatever topic that isn't the self. They're great too,		gopher.black	70
ibut I don't see them the same way. I'm sure they provide great		gopher.black	70
iinterest to people when they're published, and interesting history		gopher.black	70
ito those that come later. Sharing a personal blog is so much more		gopher.black	70
iintimate. Keeping one up for an extended period of time is its own		gopher.black	70
itype of vulnerability. It's not just showing your timely thoughts		gopher.black	70
iof today, but also the cringe-worthy worries of younger you. It's		gopher.black	70
ieasy to spotlight the mistakes, the lack of understanding, and the		gopher.black	70
iideas that you'd eventually grow out of. That's beautiful stuff,		gopher.black	70
iif horribly embarrassing.		gopher.black	70

iI started journaling when I was 14. I have a shelf of paper		gopher.black	70
ijournals sitting over there --> that I flip through still. I still		gopher.black	70
ido some paper journaling these days, too. Those moleskines aren't		gopher.black	70
igoing to fill themselves, after all.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt wasn't until 1998 that I started writing a blog online. I was		gopher.black	70
ioff to college and learning how to do all this crazy web stuff.		gopher.black	70
iI kept text notes on that website for a while (lost now even to		gopher.black	70
ithe wayback machine, sadly). I later moved to livejournal and kept		gopher.black	70
ia pretty decent journal there with a ring of friends. Thankfully		gopher.black	70
iI harvested some of those old posts before nuking my livejournal		gopher.black	70
iaccount years later. Those earliest posts on my blog now were		gopher.black	70
iwritten there. They've been updated a few times to move to		gopher.black	70
iwordpress, jekyll, and now hugo. I keep that stuff in git now,		gopher.black	70
itoo. Better peace of mind, for sure.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, I don't have much more to say on the subject. It's pretty		gopher.black	70
icool that I've almost got 20 years of journaling history up on the		gopher.black	70
iinternet myself. I hope I have much more to offer down the line in		gopher.black	70
igopher as well.		gopher.black	70
