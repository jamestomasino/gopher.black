iI was digging through some old files and ran across a story
iI started writing back in 2010 called Emergence. It's a piece of
ispeculative fiction about the creation of the world's first
iartificial intelligence. It's somewhat technical, but only enough
ito ground it in a reasonable scientific basis for development of
ithe story. My goal was to focus more on the human questions, "what
iconstitutes life?", "what is our place in a universe with AI?",
i"do our concepts of morality extend to artificial beings?".
i
iI read back on what I had written so far and it didn't horribly
ioffend me. The subject also seemed especially appropriate to the
igopher audience, you misfits with your love of old tech and duct
itape. I've picked it up and added it to my gopher hole. In fact,
iI added a whole writing section where I hope to share some other
igoodies in the future. For now, the first few chapters of the
istory can be found at the link below. Let me know what you think
iso far.
