 Writing stories
 November 23rd, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I was digging through some old files and ran across a story
 I started writing back in 2010 called Emergence. It's a piece of
 speculative fiction about the creation of the world's first
 artificial intelligence. It's somewhat technical, but only enough
 to ground it in a reasonable scientific basis for development of
 the story. My goal was to focus more on the human questions, "what
 constitutes life?", "what is our place in a universe with AI?",
 "do our concepts of morality extend to artificial beings?".
 
 I read back on what I had written so far and it didn't horribly
 offend me. The subject also seemed especially appropriate to the
 gopher audience, you misfits with your love of old tech and duct
 tape. I've picked it up and added it to my gopher hole. In fact,
 I added a whole writing section where I hope to share some other
 goodies in the future. For now, the first few chapters of the
 story can be found at the link below. Let me know what you think
 so far.
