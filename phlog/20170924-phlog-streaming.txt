Phlog Streaming
September 24th, 2017
----------------------------------------

Something I read on the bboard gave me the idea to put a stream in
place for my phlog. It's not quite RSS formatted, though I may go
ahead and build one of those as well for folks. I'm just combing
through my phlog directory and using cat to drop all the contents
into a single cgi output. If you're the type that wants a
continuous scroll with all my posts, there you are. Newest ones are
at the top.
