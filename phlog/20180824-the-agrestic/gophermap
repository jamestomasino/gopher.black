i== Introduction ==		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI wrote an opinion piece in my college newspaper about the state		gopher.black	70
iof our campus due to excessive construction during my two years		gopher.black	70
iattending. There was no grass over the vast majority of the		gopher.black	70
icampus, only churned earth or piled dirt next to broken cement		gopher.black	70
iwalkways. I don't remember much of the article except that I used		gopher.black	70
ithe word "agrestic" in a way that suggested rural beauty. The		gopher.black	70
ieditor of the paper had enormous issue with the word, claiming it		gopher.black	70
iwasn't a real word at all (her three degrees in English literature		gopher.black	70
ias proof). This outrage and logical fallacy cemented "agrestic" in		gopher.black	70
imy mind forever. Funny how brains work [0].		gopher.black	70

iThis phost isn't about that article though. This phost is about		gopher.black	70
ithe future, post-modernism, the death of the internet, and the		gopher.black	70
irise of the agrarian renaissance. Hold on to your butts, we're		gopher.black	70
igoing for a ride.		gopher.black	70

i== Time Travel == 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn 1985 Back to the Future was released. Apart from it being		gopher.black	70
ia nearly flawless film giving us endless quotability and		gopher.black	70
iestablishing a benchmark for all future time travel films, it also		gopher.black	70
icemented into my budding consciousness the idea of temporal		gopher.black	70
irelativity. By this I don't mean anything to do with Einstein's		gopher.black	70
iterminology, but rather the sense of future and past being		gopher.black	70
irelative to your own present. What seems obvious from your point		gopher.black	70
iof view today gets very complex when you take into consideration		gopher.black	70
itime travel.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iLets say you traveled back to 1955. When you say "in the future		gopher.black	70
iI want to be a rock star" do you mean back in 1985 where you're		gopher.black	70
ifrom, or in your personal future? Perhaps you'll return to your		gopher.black	70
ioriginal timeline, or perhaps like Doc Brown you'll cut ties to it		gopher.black	70
icompletely and move independently like a Time Lord. The further		gopher.black	70
iyou get away from linear existence the harder relative temporal		gopher.black	70
iterms become. Or maybe they just become less useful since they		gopher.black	70
ilack a common vantage point. If you were the Doctor traveling with		gopher.black	70
iRose Tyler, you could say, "let's get chips tomorrow" and it might		gopher.black	70
istill make sense, even if tomorrow happened to be in Victorian		gopher.black	70
iLondon.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTime travel complicates everything [1], even basic language. But		gopher.black	70
iit doesn't take a T.A.R.D.I.S. to weaken a word into		gopher.black	70
imeaninglessness. It just takes aging.		gopher.black	70

iAs a kid, the future represented sleek, pointy cars with sharp		gopher.black	70
iangles and neon colors. Badass dudes with giant shoulder pads		gopher.black	70
iwould wear opaque shades while LA and NYC were either on fire or		gopher.black	70
iunderwater. These days the future is global economic collapse as		gopher.black	70
ithe balance of power shifts to China and a waffling United States		gopher.black	70
ifalls back on military action to try and maintain a control it		gopher.black	70
igave away through isolationism. The future, in essence, is nothing		gopher.black	70
iat all. It is a fantasy in constant flux with no anchor in reality		gopher.black	70
ior common experience. It is neither hope nor fear. It is		gopher.black	70
iintangible and ineffable, and utterly useless.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn 1955, Marty McFly went back to the future. He returned to his		gopher.black	70
inineteen eighty-five where sexy mom and successful dad were ruling		gopher.black	70
ithe day. He had his truck, he had the girl, and everything was		gopher.black	70
igoing to be okay. That moment of psychological juxtaposition where		gopher.black	70
ihe physically entered into a new timeline that was not his own		gopher.black	70
iprojections of anticipation or a cultural meme of anxiety but		gopher.black	70
ia physical reality that had been shaped by actions he would never		gopher.black	70
ipersonally witness--that was like the moment of birth all over		gopher.black	70
iagain. He was in a new world, a "future" world, bearing no		gopher.black	70
isimilarity to the other meaningless definitions of the term. His		gopher.black	70
ifictional actions made fictionally-real a concept which cannot		gopher.black	70
iever be real. Rather than a tautology, this is something inverted:		gopher.black	70
iwhere the repetition of a meaningless idea becomes meaningful.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you're following my logic I commend you or apologize or both.		gopher.black	70
iUltimately what I'm getting at is that the idea of a future is		gopher.black	70
imeaningless, except in context of its own manipulation. That		gopher.black	70
imanipulation is irrelevant without time travel or some other means		gopher.black	70
iof temporal scrying. You cannot change the future if you don't		gopher.black	70
iknow what the future holds. The future is nothing becoming nothing		gopher.black	70
iotherwise. Simple, right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, it with all of this in mind that I proclaim with all the		gopher.black	70
iseriousness of IHOP rebranding as IHOb that "The Future" must		gopher.black	70
idefinitively refer to 1985 and nothing else or it will become		gopher.black	70
imeaningless once again. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBeing that the definition of definition is (yes, tautology again),		gopher.black	70
i"a statement of the meaning of a word or word group or a sign or		gopher.black	70
isymbol," then only a statement that gives meaning to the word		gopher.black	70
i"future" can rightly be called a definition. If only such		gopher.black	70
ia situation as car-washer Biff can justify a true "future", there		gopher.black	70
iyou have it. Let all other uses be damned. Change thy lexicon!		gopher.black	70

i== The Agrestic ==		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhile sitting at a Denny's in Greenwood, Indiana, staring down at		gopher.black	70
ia paper place-mat featuring "Guess Who?", I had this conversation		gopher.black	70
iwith my friend Josh. There was much coffee involved, and probably		gopher.black	70
ia burger in there somewhere, and we were more certainly awake far		gopher.black	70
itoo late in the night. My argument stated, I continued for him as		gopher.black	70
iI will for you now.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe future is over. It's been done, you see. 1985! We're well		gopher.black	70
ipassed that, even if it was a fictional version of it. If this		gopher.black	70
itime is no longer the future, or even "A" future, what is it? We		gopher.black	70
ihave generational terms, decade terms, and occasionally history		gopher.black	70
igrants a time with an overall label in retrospect. These are all		gopher.black	70
iscientific, calculated, or reactive. They don't attempt to		gopher.black	70
idescribe us while we are still in the act of being. They describe		gopher.black	70
ithe past, or they describe the calendar of the present.		gopher.black	70
iUncertainty clouds the present and the days ahead and puts us back		gopher.black	70
iinto nonsense-words again, right? 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat if we chose a nonsense word for the times we're in and the		gopher.black	70
itimes to come that wasn't bland or neutral, but instead one that		gopher.black	70
ievoked in us a primal sense of experience. Imagine that a word		gopher.black	70
icould convey in existential, individual, human terms a sense of		gopher.black	70
ithe entire days to come. It wouldn't need to be packed with		gopher.black	70
icontext from other sources but contain them within its full		gopher.black	70
iunderstanding.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAgrestic.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat is the "future" I envision and put forth in my own mind and		gopher.black	70
iin my interactions with the world. It can be summed up as the		gopher.black	70
ilogical conclusion to the phrase:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Then they all decided the internet was a pretty bad idea."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat happens next. What do we find. Rustic. Beauty. The Earth.		gopher.black	70
iHuman animals in the dirt, in the trees, in the seas. Unpack as		gopher.black	70
imuch as you can from the word and from its idea and from all that		gopher.black	70
icame before it and let it saturate you.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIs it silly, is it absurd, is it infinitely unlikely to happen?		gopher.black	70
iWho cares? Flying cars are EXACTLY as absurd.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's the key to the whole thing: whatever you aim at you're not		gopher.black	70
igoing to hit, but you're going to end up close. If you aim at		gopher.black	70
iflying cars and nuclear war... I don't want to go there with you.		gopher.black	70
iIf you aim at a world where we found peace with our planet and		gopher.black	70
ididn't let our creations define us then everyone deserves some		gopher.black	70
igod-damned high fives in my book.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAgrestic. Say it with me. It may not be a word (it really, really		gopher.black	70
iis a word), but that doesn't matter. It's in your head and it's in		gopher.black	70
imy head and it's more fucking real than a flux capacitor.		gopher.black	70
