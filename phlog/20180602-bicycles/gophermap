iI posted a picture of my bicycle over on Mastodon. As I mentioned		gopher.black	70
ithere, I have no real background with bikes beyond riding one as		gopher.black	70
ia kid. I bought an old racer off a guy in college and that's been		gopher.black	70
imy bike for most of my adult life. It was seriously uncomfortable.		gopher.black	70
iThe seat was like a spear into my butt and I sat completely folded		gopher.black	70
iin half. The bike was really light weight, but that doesn't matter		gopher.black	70
iif you are sitting on top of it.		gopher.black	70

iA few years back I decided that I deserved a more comfortable		gopher.black	70
ibike. I went to the shop in town and told them I wanted to sit		gopher.black	70
iupright and have a squishy seat. They found me a great bike that		gopher.black	70
iI tested out. It was so much better than my old one. The frame		gopher.black	70
isays "Specialized", or something like it. It might be the brand or		gopher.black	70
ithe model. I have no idea. It's a 7 speed thing and easy to shift		gopher.black	70
iwith a twist of the right handle. It mostly doesn't hurt me to		gopher.black	70
iride it, and that's a plus.		gopher.black	70

iSo, all you bike nerds, what can you tell me about my bike? Is it		gopher.black	70
ia decent thing? Is there a reason my hands still go numb when		gopher.black	70
iI ride more than a few miles? Any advice for making biking suck		gopher.black	70
iless (I still prefer walking).		gopher.black	70
