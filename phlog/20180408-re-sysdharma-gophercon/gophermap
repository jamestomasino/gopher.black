iI was so excited about the possibility of a gophercon when I saw	
ithe first mention of Brazil. I was just as heartbroken when it	
iturned out (once again) to be about Go-lang. It drives me crazy	
ithat they keep using "gopher" for everything. Fakes me out every	
itime. Boo.	
i	
iBitreich has something they do in Germany for gopher, but I'm not	
isure what sort of attendance it gets or if it's more for their	
iprivate community. I'd love a real gopher (1436) conference, but	
iwe regular users are far too spread out around the globe. I can't	
iimagine many people traveling across continents to attend. Maybe	
ia virtual thing? Do those work?	
i	
iIf we were to have a conference I think it should either be called	
isimply "1436con" or "Port 70". No confusion there. What sort of	
ithings would happen at a conference for gopher? Ideas:	
i	
i  - A talk or two on TLS and Gopher over Tor 	
i  - Panel discussion on the pros & cons of adding new ItemTypes	
i  - "To gophermap or not to gophermap, that is the question"	
i  - Social networking on legacy, minimal systems	
i  - Other sociological stuff about community	
i  - "Content is King"	
i	
iWhat else?
