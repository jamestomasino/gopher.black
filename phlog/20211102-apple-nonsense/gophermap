iMy son has in iPad. It's actually one that I nabbed from work when		gopher.black	70
iwe left the states. It's his only tech device. He uses it and		gopher.black	70
iabuses it as only a kid can.		gopher.black	70

iI recently picked up an iPad for work. I build sales aid things		gopher.black	70
ithat live on them and needed one for testing. That brought our		gopher.black	70
itotal apple devices in the house to two, so I figured it was time		gopher.black	70
ito get us set up on the family stuff.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI was logged into both iPads with my apple ID because my kid is		gopher.black	70
ia kid and didn't have his own. When I created the family thingy		gopher.black	70
iI added him and now he's got his own apple identity. The only		gopher.black	70
iproblem is, the process didn't ask for a password creation. 		gopher.black	70

iI realized yesterday that both iPads are still under my ID, so		gopher.black	70
iI went to switch his to his ID and got stuck at the login screen.		gopher.black	70
iI didn't have a password for him, so I followed the link to reset		gopher.black	70
iit. After verifying the request via his email address and my phone		gopher.black	70
i(text) Apple informed me that I'd get a note about the reset in		gopher.black	70
ia few days.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn a few days?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWell I just got the email, a full day later, and I'm not		gopher.black	70
iimpressed. Apparently someone from Apple is going to call my phone		gopher.black	70
inumber on November 15th at a very specific time (quite late,		gopher.black	70
iactually). That's my reset process? Seriously? Apple, the richest		gopher.black	70
icompany on Earth, and that's the plan?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've never been a fan of Apple. I just don't understand the appeal		gopher.black	70
iat all. Even the stuff they're supposed to be good at is utter		gopher.black	70
ishit. I really wish I could go from 2 devices to 0.		gopher.black	70
