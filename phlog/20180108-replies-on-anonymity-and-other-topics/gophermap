 On Anonymity:
 
 Many folks around gopherspace [0-3] have been talking about
 anonymity or pseudoanonymity in their online profiles, phlogs,
 blogs, etc. I walked into this one with one opinion and have made
 a complete turnaround since.
 
 I don't use an anonymous handle here on SDF. My username is my
 last name. You can see my first name if you hit my about [4] page.
 I prefer to associate my real identity with the activites I do
 here because I feel like it helps add to the public representation
 of who I am. It may help me with social networking and potentially
 even employment one day.
 
 That being said, I have a lot of activity I do online that isn't
 under this identity. I tools in place for creating easy throw-away
 accounts, and I have invested a great deal of time in building up
 robust, persistent identities that are sufficient to provide me
 anonymity against all but the strongest state-level actors. I use
 them for... well, if I told you that would weaken them.
 
 I love the idea of anonymity in principle, but I have seen how
 easy it is for that freedom to become an excuse for disruptive and
 poisonous behavior. The things people will say when there's no
 name attached can be downright horrific. Is that worth the cost?
 I really don't know how I feel to make a solid decision.
 
 I do know that pseudo anonymity is helpful in protecting against
 the anonymous actions of others, like SWATing. It can also prevent
 prejudice from entering a community dynamic. The work stands for
 itself, right? That's the idea at least, and I think that's
 a happy medium.
 
 If you have an identity, even a false one, and you must act and
 share and communicate with that identity, then it gains value to
 you over time. It also gains peer status as others get to know
 you. If ZeLibertineGamer, or solderpunk, or jynx communicate with
 me, I have a basis for understanding where that communication is
 coming from. It has context. If they were to do something or say
 something that the community found unfit, there's an identity that
 would suffer the social consequences. It may not be a person with
 an address, but there is a community cost nontheless. In that way,
 our pseudo-identities gain some of the social value and costs that
 our real identities do, but without the personal risk. I think
 that's a really great middle ground.
 
 When I walked into the first of these phlog posts I was on the
 side of "just use your real identity". You are all great at making
 you case.
 
 On Gophermaps and formatting:
 
 This is mostly in reference to pet84rik [5], but it applies to
 everyone. I don't believe there's a right way or a wrong way to
 gopher. You can put up whatever you like in whatever format. Ulcer
 has a super intricate system of phlogging and tag cross-links.
 I make heavy use of gophermaps for linking but otherwise do things
 fairly manual. Cat lovingly crafts everything by hand. Some people
 just drop text files in a directory and it's up to us to parse it.
 
 That's the crux. If you put something up here, some people will go
 through the effort to read it and others wont. If you don't use
 gophermaps that might be a barrier for some people. If you want to
 cater to them and make it easy, that's cool. Gopher readers are
 pretty resourceful. We'll figure it out.
 
 Welcomes:
 
 A big welcome to jebug29 and gunnarfrost. Glad to see your stuff.
 You're not shouting into a void; we're reading.
 
 Cookbook:
 
 Finally, a big shout out to jandal who has put up a really cool
 Gopherspace Cookbook [6]. My recipes are included and a bunch more
 from all around the place. It's been helpful in discovering new
 phlogs as well. Thanks, jandal. Great work. Maybe more people will
 share their recipes in the future.
