iVF-1 is fast, but it's also pretty basic. It doesn't (yet) do		gopher.black	70
ipretty colors by types or anything sweet like that. Many of you		gopher.black	70
iare probably fine with that. "Colors are useless" people... I 		gopher.black	70
ihear you, but I don't agree.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn fact, even if the colors aren't structured, I still want them!		gopher.black	70
iI've been piping my VF-1 output through lolcat for a few months.		gopher.black	70
iIt's brilliant, but was incomplete.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNot to mention any names, but some of you don't wrap your text. I		gopher.black	70
itry not to be picky about whether wrapping happens at 80cols or at		gopher.black	70
i67cols, but when a gopher doesn't wrap at all it makes it very		gopher.black	70
ihard to read. I'll be honest, I usually just skim those posts as a		gopher.black	70
iresult.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Why," I ask myself, "don't they just run it through fold(1)?"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Duh," I answer myself, "they don't want to or don't care."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"But self, it would make my reading more convenient!"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Come'on, tomasino. What part of _don't care_ did you not get?"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"I suppose you have a point. You're pretty smart."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Damn right..."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"So..."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Oh crap--"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Why don't you solve it on the client end?"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd I sigh and say, "Of course. VF-1 lets me lolcat. Why not fold		gopher.black	70
ias well? It should be simple."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you don't care about lolcat and only want to fold output		gopher.black	70
iautomatically in VF-1, here's what you do. Add the following line		gopher.black	70
ito your ~/.vf1rc:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ cat ~/.vf1rc		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  handler text/plain fold -sw 80 %s		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you want to lolcat it too, like me, then you need to do a		gopher.black	70
ilittle bit more. I'm not sure what method VF-1 uses internally to		gopher.black	70
iparse the handlers, but it chokes hard on pipes. So, I wrote a very,		gopher.black	70
ivery basic shell script to do it for me.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ cat ~/bin/goph		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  #!/bin/sh		gopher.black	70
i  FIN=${1:-"/dev/stdin"}		gopher.black	70
i  fold -sw 80 "$FIN" | lolcat -f		gopher.black	70
i 		gopher.black	70
iPut that in your PATH and now you can pipe anything you want to		gopher.black	70
i'goph' and have it be pretty. It'll also take a file input. Then,		gopher.black	70
iin your ~/.vf1rc, you can add:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ cat ~/.vf1rc		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  handler text/plain goph %s		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iLet there be color, and pretty wrapping. Enjoy.		gopher.black	70
