iThere's definitely something going on in my brain. I slipped off	
imy good diet and have been eating like crap again the last couple	
iweeks. On the one hand there's great pleasure in the moment while	
idowning a patty melt, but I know the costs are so high on my body	
iand my mind. How can I get myself to stop the cycle even when	
ilogic screams at me to do so and I ignore it?	
i	
iThis latest attempt lasted about 3 months until I caved and	
istarted walking the dangerous edge with sugar and carbs. Then, as	
ialways happens, I had a bad day and let it all go.	
i	
iThis weekend has been awful. I've felt terrible both in body and	
iin my psyche. I have no care or love for the things I'm doing. My	
ihobbies seem boring. My job is a chore that I'd walk away from if	
ithere was any way to do it financially. My mind goes to dark	
iplaces and I feel alone.	
i	
iThis is chemistry at work in my brain, or gut, or whatever. I know	
ihow the hormones lie. I see it clearly, but like the diet itself	
imy logic can't seem to override the rest.	
i	
iTommorow I'll go back on my diet, I can decide. That will fix it,	
iand it surely will if I follow through. Why is there any effort	
ineeded? Why am I sitting here fearing that tomorrow I'll get up	
iand make a bowl of cereal instead of bacon and eggs? Why, when	
iI know with absolute certainty that everything in my life will be	
ibetter as a result. I'll even be happier with the taste of it in	
ithe moment. What the hell is wrong with my brain when that's even	
iin question?
