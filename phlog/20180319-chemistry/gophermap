iThere's definitely something going on in my brain. I slipped off		gopher.black	70
imy good diet and have been eating like crap again the last couple		gopher.black	70
iweeks. On the one hand there's great pleasure in the moment while		gopher.black	70
idowning a patty melt, but I know the costs are so high on my body		gopher.black	70
iand my mind. How can I get myself to stop the cycle even when		gopher.black	70
ilogic screams at me to do so and I ignore it?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis latest attempt lasted about 3 months until I caved and		gopher.black	70
istarted walking the dangerous edge with sugar and carbs. Then, as		gopher.black	70
ialways happens, I had a bad day and let it all go.		gopher.black	70

iThis weekend has been awful. I've felt terrible both in body and		gopher.black	70
iin my psyche. I have no care or love for the things I'm doing. My		gopher.black	70
ihobbies seem boring. My job is a chore that I'd walk away from if		gopher.black	70
ithere was any way to do it financially. My mind goes to dark		gopher.black	70
iplaces and I feel alone.		gopher.black	70

iThis is chemistry at work in my brain, or gut, or whatever. I know		gopher.black	70
ihow the hormones lie. I see it clearly, but like the diet itself		gopher.black	70
imy logic can't seem to override the rest.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTommorow I'll go back on my diet, I can decide. That will fix it,		gopher.black	70
iand it surely will if I follow through. Why is there any effort		gopher.black	70
ineeded? Why am I sitting here fearing that tomorrow I'll get up		gopher.black	70
iand make a bowl of cereal instead of bacon and eggs? Why, when		gopher.black	70
iI know with absolute certainty that everything in my life will be		gopher.black	70
ibetter as a result. I'll even be happier with the taste of it in		gopher.black	70
ithe moment. What the hell is wrong with my brain when that's even		gopher.black	70
iin question?		gopher.black	70
