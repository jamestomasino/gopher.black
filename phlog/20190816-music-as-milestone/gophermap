iPassing through major change makes itself manifest in a number of		gopher.black	70
iways. For me, one of the most notable is a musical genre shift.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAt the end of a long and tumultuous relationship I set out on		gopher.black	70
ia thirteen hour drive home, newly single, skipping through		gopher.black	70
istations at 5am in search of something to capture the hole I felt		gopher.black	70
iinside. I caught the beginning of Mountain Stage on NPR (National		gopher.black	70
iPublic Radio) as a trio was just starting out. The band, The Be		gopher.black	70
iGood Tanyas [0], are a folk/Americana band from Canada. They		gopher.black	70
istarted out their set with a cover of the gospel song, "In My Time		gopher.black	70
iof Dying", most famously performed by Led Zeppelin & Blind Willie		gopher.black	70
iJohnson [1].		gopher.black	70

iThere it was, the resonating echo of my inner self. I was hooked		gopher.black	70
iand would go on to binge the bluegrassy/folk/Americana		gopher.black	70
iscene--especially the likes of Jolie Holland--to great depths over		gopher.black	70
ithe next few years. It was a music for the time.		gopher.black	70

iYears earlier I experienced something similar with Enya that you		gopher.black	70
ican all thank for my multi-hour "All Enya" streams on tilderadio.		gopher.black	70
iJoining the Navy took me on a wild ride of electronica and		gopher.black	70
ieuro-vocal-trance. My time in Alaska introduced me to the depths		gopher.black	70
iof Nordic electronic minimalism.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd so, with the move to Iceland I expected something to develop.		gopher.black	70
iI know that my tastes would shift. I already adore so many		gopher.black	70
iIcelandic bands, would that grow and encompass a major part of my		gopher.black	70
ilife? Would I slide deeper into the fediverse's obsession with		gopher.black	70
ivaporwave? Apparently the answer is no.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSomehow--illogically--I've found myself listening to Reggae [2,3].		gopher.black	70

iI'm not sure if I can say definitively that this is my new jam,		gopher.black	70
ibut it sure is happening a lot. I guess it proves that you can't		gopher.black	70
ipredict what the future will hold.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat are your signs of change? Do you change tastes in music like		gopher.black	70
ime, or is it something else? Change nicknames? Take up new		gopher.black	70
ihobbies?		gopher.black	70
