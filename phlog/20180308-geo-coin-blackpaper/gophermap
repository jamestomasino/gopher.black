 Geo-Coin Blackpaper
 March 08th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 In 2013 I had a conversation with a coworker about Bitcoin. What
 is it? I asked. No, no, I mean, how does it all work? I repeated.
 We went on like this for a few days before he eventually just told
 me to read this whitepaper [0]. Ahh, now I get it... well mostly.
 
 It makes sense from a logical point of view: how do you build
 a platform that can naturally prove things true without needing
 a 3rd party? Well, you build truth into its very existence. What
 if the universe were nothing but a giant ledger?
 
 At that time my coworker had become involved in a community
 takeover of an alt-coin, a crypo-currency which had become
 abandoned by its creator. He had some grand plans but the coin
 failed to gain traction. In a sense theirs was a precursor to
 Z-Cash and Dash in the anonymity space. It had great plans and
 lofty goals, but no clear path to reach them.
 
 Around that time I also gave some thought to another
 crypto-currency which I thought had potential to be meaningful
 from an economic point of view. My premise was a coin with a value
 that relative to its transaction-point geographically. In short:
 
   Geo-Coin
 
   A crypto-currency designed for the development of local markets.
   At the heart of the Geo-Coin system is the addition of geographic
   proof to proof-of-work. Every mined coin is done so with
   a specific geographic location attached to its identity.
   Wallets, as points of reception in a transaction, also hold
   geographic location as part of their identity. A wallet can hold
   coin values without degradation if they share geographies. As
   the wallet and coin increase distance, part of the value of the
   coin is lost. In this way, the further a coin "travels" the less
   its net worth in the system.
 
 Why didn't I pursue this idea, you might ask (unless you're
 already prepared to tear the idea apart, you vicious bastard)?
 Well, I'm not sure it's sound, first-of-all. It's possible that if
 you expend a great deal of resources you could create wallets
 using a false location shared by the source coin, hold it all in
 trust in a billion little wallets, and then trade without loss.
 That is, assuming that the proof of geography is something that
 can be spoofed.
 
 That's surely part of the reason. The other big factor is that
 it's a lot of work, and I don't care all that much. Great ideas
 (if this even counts) aren't worth 1% of success. Well over 99% is
 the effort you put in. I don't need to spend that amount of time
 in crypto. The idea makes me feel gross.
 
 Finally, I could never crack the big problem. How do you prove
 location? Give it some thought and see if you can come up with
 something that can't be manipulated. With that piece of the puzzle
 the rest should be doable. If you can make it work, take it and
 run. More power to you. All license or copyright or other legal
 shenanigans is hereby revoked.
 
 Enjoy (you vicious bastard)
