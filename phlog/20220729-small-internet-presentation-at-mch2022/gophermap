iI'm back home from the Netherlands and MCH2022 (May Contain		gopher.black	70
iHackers). It was a whirlwind and quite awesome. I'm just floored		gopher.black	70
iby how much stuff a bunch of volunteers can accomplish with		gopher.black	70
imotivation and creative hacking.		gopher.black	70

iThe talks were amazing and most can now be found online on the CCC		gopher.black	70
isite. There was also an epic CTF game going on the whole week (I		gopher.black	70
ihelped out in some lock picking challenges). The ad-hoc villages		gopher.black	70
icreated by visitors were endless fun too. What a wild ride. I hope		gopher.black	70
iyou all get the chance to attend one of these hacker camps in the		gopher.black	70
ifuture.		gopher.black	70

iI participated in one group panel discussion on social media,		gopher.black	70
idisinformation, and fascism that was really interesting, but not		gopher.black	70
irecorded. I also gave one of the curated stage presentations which		gopher.black	70
iwas recorded [0].		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iMy main talk was about the small internet, and specifically about		gopher.black	70
igopher and gemini. It covers some framing for what people mean by		gopher.black	70
ithe term small internet, what services and activities fall under		gopher.black	70
ithe umbrella, and a bit of sentiment and behavior information from		gopher.black	70
ithe survey I shared here earlier. Then I run through a quick		gopher.black	70
itechnical overview of gopher and gemini, and finish off with		gopher.black	70
ia quick nod at pubnix and tildes. The questions from the audience		gopher.black	70
iwere wonderful and I hope it broadens awareness of our fun little		gopher.black	70
ispaces. If you want to see the slides from the presentation,		gopher.black	70
