iThat's what it feels like right now, even with all the		gopher.black	70
ipreparation. I lost my dad tonight. About an hour ago, in fact.		gopher.black	70
iI didn't get to say goodbye, but my sister did. I'm glad for that.		gopher.black	70
iHe's not suffering anymore, and neither is my mom. I'm glad for		gopher.black	70
ithat too. I'm glad I had time to prepare for it, to think on it		gopher.black	70
iand test my emotions in the years leading up to this. I'm also		gopher.black	70
ireally glad for all the time I had with him.		gopher.black	70

iIt's just that after all of that gratitude and reason I eventually		gopher.black	70
ihit a memory where he isn't my dad, but he is daddy and I'm eight		gopher.black	70
iyears old again and it is an unfathomable pit of despair that		gopher.black	70
iopens around me knowing that he's gone and I can't ever hold him		gopher.black	70
ior talk to him again. I'll carry that part until my own days are		gopher.black	70
iup.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI won't want my son to feel this way. I'll want him to be happy		gopher.black	70
iwith his life and live it brilliantly. My dad surely wants the		gopher.black	70
isame. I'm glad for that knowledge too. I just miss my daddy.		gopher.black	70
