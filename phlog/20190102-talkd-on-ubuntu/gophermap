iI need to save these notes somewhere. I just got talkd working on		gopher.black	70
iubuntu 18.10 and it was quite convoluted. Here's what I did:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- install openbsd-inetd (not inetutils-inetd, it's shit)		gopher.black	70
i- install talkd (not inetutils-talkd, also shit)		gopher.black	70
i- install ytalk (better than talk by a mile)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iedit /etc/inetd.conf and add the following:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i#:BSD: Shell, login, exec and talk are BSD protocols.		gopher.black	70
italk   dgram udp wait nobody.tty /usr/sbin/tcpd in.talkd		gopher.black	70
intalk  dgram udp wait nobody.tty /usr/sbin/tcpd in.ntalkd 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
inote the /usr/sbin/tcpd. If talkd added content here for you,		gopher.black	70
ithose are probably quite different. Trust tcpd to handle the		gopher.black	70
iconnection for you and hand it off to in.talkd and in.ntalkd		gopher.black	70
iafterwards. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i'nobody' will probably need to be added to the tty group. In truth		gopher.black	70
iyou should make another dummy user without a login shell named		gopher.black	70
i'talkd' and add THAT user to tty, but this works.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i$ sudo usermod -a -G tty nobody		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iRestart inetd:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i$ sudo service openbsd-inetd restart		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow you should be able to use 'talk' on your server, locally at		gopher.black	70
ileast.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPorts 517 and 518 are for talkd, so you can open them up in your		gopher.black	70
ifirewall and that should be enough to talk to other servers, but		gopher.black	70
iI don't have that piece of the puzzle just yet.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iGood luck!		gopher.black	70
