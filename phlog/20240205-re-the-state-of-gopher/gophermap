iIanJ of gopher.icu wrote a quick rant on things that bother him		gopher.black	70
iabout the current state of gopher[0]. In short, line length,		gopher.black	70
imisuse of type i, and escape codes for things like color		gopher.black	70
ideccoration. We run into this sort of gopher purism a lot in the		gopher.black	70
ibitreich community. It's not new, and it's also a perfectly fine		gopher.black	70
iopinion. I just don't share it.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iLets talk about the three mentioned things in turn:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFirst: Lines should be 70 charactes or fewer.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is indeed in the spec, and it was the impetus for my choosing		gopher.black	70
isixty-seven as the line length I use here on gopher.black. But in		gopher.black	70
igeneral a line length of 80 or fewer characters won't cause		gopher.black	70
iproblems for anyone on a desktop and a line length of 67 is still		gopher.black	70
ifar too wide to be useful on mobile. So what are we to do?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSome people forgo wrapping at all, assuming clients are capable of		gopher.black	70
iwrapping if they're sosphisticated. Others pick a comfortable		gopher.black	70
imiddle-ground (often 80) and stick with it half out of convenience		gopher.black	70
iand half because it's good enough. Still others who use gopher on		gopher.black	70
imobile choose to go crazy and use very narrow posts that fit those		gopher.black	70
iscreens.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTo the spec it's wrong, but the spec doesn't have feelings. The		gopher.black	70
ispec doesn't use gopher. If someone is on their phone and very		gopher.black	70
inarrow lines make their use case better then that's absolutely the		gopher.black	70
iright call. At the end of the day it just isn't very important.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSecond: misuse of type-i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFrom a historical perspective type i wasn't even in the spec, but		gopher.black	70
iit was already in widespread use in gopherspace within the first		gopher.black	70
iyear of its launch. Clients adjusted, use adjusted. RFC-1436[1]		gopher.black	70
inever learned to time travel, though, and remains sadly silent on		gopher.black	70
ithe topic. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[1] RFC-1436	/archive/rfc/1436.txt
i		gopher.black	70
iWhy use type i gophermaps for things like this phlog? It makes it		gopher.black	70
ieasy to link to things, like the RFC above. I could drop in		gopher.black	70
ia gopher URL instead, but wait... those didn't exist when RFC-1436		gopher.black	70
icame out either. So should I instead list a selector, server, and		gopher.black	70
iport? Oh, I better indicate a type as well. No, that's silly. Even		gopher.black	70
ithough the URL scheme came later it's a useful convention. It		gopher.black	70
imakes it easier for other people. See where I'm going?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo why NOT use type i in this way? Well, two reasons. First, it's		gopher.black	70
iharder to lay out. Working in gophermaps is nasty business.		gopher.black	70
iI wrote a tool[2] to do it for me. Without that I wouldn't do it.		gopher.black	70
iIt's easy to screw up and awful to edit later. Easier just to		gopher.black	70
iwrite plain text, and plain text is sufficient.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[2] Burrow	URL:https://github.com/jamestomasino/burrow
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd the second reason? Very old clients like the original UMN		gopher.black	70
igopher client don't work well with them.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThankfully very few people use that client anynmore because it's		gopher.black	70
ipretty janky and has barely been maintained. Last I heard it was		gopher.black	70
iin search of a new maintainer, actually. And these days we have		gopher.black	70
ia wealth of new clients that are simply fantastic. We have the		gopher.black	70
inear-ubiquitous lynx which does a fair job, though notably is		gopher.black	70
iconverting to HTML under the hood. But the bitreich community		gopher.black	70
imentioned earlier has led to the creation of at least two gopher		gopher.black	70
iclients I know of that match that gopher purist philosophy. We		gopher.black	70
ialso have VF-1, a lovely python client that inspired a fork for		gopher.black	70
ioffline browsing of the whole small internet, and another fork for		gopher.black	70
igemini. Bombadillo is fun, and there's my most recent favorite,		gopher.black	70
iphetch. Lots of options all with better features and better		gopher.black	70
ihandling of gopherspace.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFor me, the benifits of being able to link within the documents		gopher.black	70
ioutweighs the negatives. The format is subverted with my tooling,		gopher.black	70
iand I don't feel the need to lower my gopher content to an ancient		gopher.black	70
iclient when there's so many easy alternatives available.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThird: escape codes		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's I'll agree partially. gopherspace shouldn't assume terminal		gopher.black	70
ienvironments. Remember the phone users earlier? Generally speaking		gopher.black	70
iit's safer not to do so. But that being said, some places in		gopher.black	70
igopher space are not just gopher holes. They're not just phlogs.		gopher.black	70
iThey are art installations. They are pushing the boundaries of		gopher.black	70
iwhat's possible and what's decent because that's what art does.		gopher.black	70
iI am of course thinking primarily of cat's baud.baby[3] here, but		gopher.black	70
ithere are some other gems around as well. They blow my mind when		gopher.black	70
iI see what can be created in this long forgotten corner of the		gopher.black	70
iinternet. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
1[3] baud.baby	/	baud.baby	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut it's only visible in certain ways! Yeah, that's true. You		gopher.black	70
imight stumble on there and go, "AHH! What a mess!" and miss out on		gopher.black	70
ithe awesome. That'd be too bad. If that's the case you should grab		gopher.black	70
iphetch and try again. It's worth it. Maybe not for all of gopher,		gopher.black	70
ibut for this particular thing. Keep doing what you're doing, cat.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iGopher is a pretty cool thing. It's got limits that make it		gopher.black	70
iawesome because it forces us to focus on content most of the time.		gopher.black	70
iThose limits aren't the point, though. The place it leads us to		gopher.black	70
iare the point. If we disagree on some of the details getting		gopher.black	70
ithere, so be it. After all, this is in UTF-8, not Latin-1 as the		gopher.black	70
ispec calls for which lets me do some great things, like share		gopher.black	70
