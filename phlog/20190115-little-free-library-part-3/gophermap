iThe batter test is complete. I picked up a solar powered battery		gopher.black	70
ipack off Amazon and plugged in the pi, then left it in the dark to		gopher.black	70
isee how long it took to drain. It lasted just over 80 hours with		gopher.black	70
ino external charging. That's fantastic! 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe unit claims that it can fully recharge in about 7 hours of		gopher.black	70
isunlight. Given various seasons and overcast days, rain, etc, that		gopher.black	70
ishould be plenty of buffer to allow the pi to remain perpetually		gopher.black	70
iactive.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWith that, there's only 3 things left to do:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Update the captive portal screen to indicate to users that they		gopher.black	70
i  should: 1) disable their mobile data, and 2) browse to		gopher.black	70
i  http://littlefreelibrary.  The actual domain doesn't matter, but		gopher.black	70
i  that one seems easy enough to remember. The mobile data thing		gopher.black	70
i  came up in testing as a barrier to IP rules running on the Pi		gopher.black	70
i  that would normally redirect you to 10.0.0.5 and serve the web		gopher.black	70
i  content. Captive Portal may trigger, but I need a real redirect		gopher.black	70
i  of a real mobile browser for downloads. If you're reading this		gopher.black	70
i  and making a project that doesn't need javascript or downloads,		gopher.black	70
i  just do it IN the captive portal. It's much easier.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Build a weatherproof enclosure. The plan is to 3D print		gopher.black	70
i  something that can hold the battery and pi, or just the pi glued		gopher.black	70
i  on the battery, or a big glass box, or whatever. Something that		gopher.black	70
i  will survive in the woods and not be blocked by snowfall.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Take pictures and "blog" the full build instructions so others		gopher.black	70
i  can replicate and share it. This is a cool project and I hope		gopher.black	70
i  others can build upon it.		gopher.black	70
