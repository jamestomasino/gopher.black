iThere's a fantastic article circulating on the typical nerd		gopher.black	70
iportals today regarding "deep work" and "deliberate practice" [0].		gopher.black	70
iGive it a read if you haven't already.		gopher.black	70

h[0] The Importance of Deep Work	URL:http://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/
i		gopher.black	70
iOne of the things I enjoyed most about the post was the summary of		gopher.black	70
imethods of deep work taken from a great book on the subject [1].		gopher.black	70

i  Monastic: 		gopher.black	70
i  "This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by		gopher.black	70
i  eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations."		gopher.black	70
i  — isolate yourself for long periods of time without		gopher.black	70
i  distractions; no shallow work allowed. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Bimodal: 		gopher.black	70
i  "This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some		gopher.black	70
i  clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest		gopher.black	70
i  open to everything else." – dedicate a few consecutive days		gopher.black	70
i  (like weekends, or a Sunday, for example) for deep work only, at		gopher.black	70
i  least one day a week.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Rhythmic: 		gopher.black	70
i  "This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently		gopher.black	70
i  start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple		gopher.black	70
i  regular habit." – create a daily habit of three to four hours		gopher.black	70
i  every day to perform deep work on your project.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Journalistic: 		gopher.black	70
i  "in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your		gopher.black	70
i  schedule." — Not recommended to try out first, since you first		gopher.black	70
i  need to accustom yourself to deep work.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis put into words a struggle I've had with my own strategies.		gopher.black	70
iI've tried dedicating a set amount of time, sort of like "Rythmic"		gopher.black	70
ibut that time hasn't been long enough to establish a deep work		gopher.black	70
iflow. I've set aside days of the week for it like Bimodal, but		gopher.black	70
irarely with the isolation necessary to really dig in. Occasionally		gopher.black	70
iI'm successful, but I think it's more to do with luck, or		gopher.black	70
ia motivation I happened to find that day, than any deliberatet		gopher.black	70
iplanning.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the past I've spoken about freezing up when an opportunity for		gopher.black	70
iexploration appears [2]. I'm combatting that with organization of		gopher.black	70
ilists so I can refer back to these projects I have moving and		gopher.black	70
iI don't waste time spinning my wheels. All of it is a part of the		gopher.black	70
ieffort to get back the time that should belong to me that I give		gopher.black	70
iaway out of a combination of laziness and poor planning [3].		gopher.black	70

iUltimately, there are skills I want to improve. The top of that		gopher.black	70
ilist are my writing craft and the Shakuhachi [4]. In reality the		gopher.black	70
ilist is quite a bit longer. Even so, I have the ability, I have		gopher.black	70
ithe time, and I have the necessary components to make a go of it.		gopher.black	70

1[4] Shakuhachi (UTF-8)	/explorations/shakuhachi
i		gopher.black	70
iDeliberate practice, not just sitting around fiddling with crap,		gopher.black	70
iis the difference I'm missing. I've told it to my son a lot, and		gopher.black	70
iI'll continue to do so in the future. You can't just go along with		gopher.black	70
ithings and expect to learn and grow. You need to do the hard		gopher.black	70
ithings [5]. When I practice with the Shakuhachi, I can't just go		gopher.black	70
isit on the porch and play improvisations for twenty minutes.		gopher.black	70
iI have specific things I need to improve: timing, embouchure,		gopher.black	70
ibreathing dynamics. My writing is the same. I'm working on		gopher.black	70
ia writing exercise and I've given myself a specific goal to focus		gopher.black	70
ion brevity. This is good.		gopher.black	70

iIt's not just about doing things with my hobby time. It's work in		gopher.black	70
iitself and I need to commit to it, at least a significant portion		gopher.black	70
iof the time, if I want to improve.		gopher.black	70
