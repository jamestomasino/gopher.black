iacme.sh shenanigans

iThese are notes to myself on how I finally got acme.sh and nginx	
ito play nice.	
i	
i	
iStep 1: Generate a cert	
i	
iI'm using the namesilo api method here, so this part is simple.	
i	
iacme.sh --issue --dns dns_namesilo --dnssleep 900 -d tomasino.org	
i-d www.tomasino.org -w /var/www	
i	
iStep 2: Create a place to put those certs	
i	
iThis part was a struggle. Since acme.sh doesn't need root to run,	
iso I wasn't sure where to go. Eventually I settled on creating	
ia directory at /etc/nginx/acme.sh/domain/ and changed ownership to	
iwww-data:www-data. I'm a member of that group and nginx works with	
ithat too, so it should be good.	
i	
iStep 3: Install the certs	
i	
iThis is poorly documented pretty much everywhere. It will pull the	
ifiles from the .acme.sh directory in your home folder and put them	
iwherever you define here. The reload command will run as root, so	
iyou don't need to specify sudo. 	
i	
iacme.sh --install-cert -d tomasino.org --key-file	
i/etc/nginx/acme.sh/tomasino.org/key.pem --cert-file	
i/etc/nginx/acme.sh/tomasino.org/cert.pem --fullchain-file	
i/etc/nginx/acme.sh/tomasino.org/fullchain.pem --reloadcmd	
i"service nginx force-reload"	
i	
iStep 4: Set up the nginx configuration	
i	
iFirst, a server directive on port 80 that just redirects to the	
issl version.	
i	
iSecond, listen on 443, add a bunch of headers, set up ssl	
iprotocols, ciphers, link to the cert, key, and trusted cert	
i(fullchain). Etc, etc...	
i	
iStep 5: Restart/Start nginx	
i	
iHopefully it doesn't crap out on you like it did for me 5,000	
itimes.
