iRSS Feed

iAfter the mini-poll on the last post I have decided to keep my	
igophermap formatting on my phlog. As a sign of faith to the text	
ipurists, I am now generating a happy little RSS feed for the most	
irecent 10 posts. You can find the feed here [0] and also see	
ia link to it on my main gophermap [1].	
i	
0[0] gopher.black RSS feed	/rss.xml
1[1] gopher.black	/
i	
iFor those of you using newsbeuter, you can add this to your feed	
ilist by dropping this line into the 'urls' file:	
i	
i  "exec:curl -s gopher://gopher.black/0/rss.xml"	
i	
iTo accomplish this, rather than add a cgi script to my site,	
iI decided to add the RSS generation feature to burrow.	
i	
i  $ burrow rss # generates the rss feed	
i	
iThere's also a config parameter to auto-generate RSS when writing	
inew phlogs. Check out the man page or README.md to see more.	
i	
iNOTE: There's one little weakness of my RSS generator. It will	
iorganize the most recent entries by date, but if you post multiple	
ientries in a single day, it just alphabetizes them. I'm sure you	
iguys can all deal with it.
