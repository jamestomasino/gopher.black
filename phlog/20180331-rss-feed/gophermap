iAfter the mini-poll on the last post I have decided to keep my		gopher.black	70
igophermap formatting on my phlog. As a sign of faith to the text		gopher.black	70
ipurists, I am now generating a happy little RSS feed for the most		gopher.black	70
irecent 10 posts. You can find the feed here [0] and also see		gopher.black	70
ia link to it on my main gophermap [1].		gopher.black	70

iFor those of you using newsbeuter, you can add this to your feed		gopher.black	70
ilist by dropping this line into the 'urls' file:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  "exec:curl -s gopher://gopher.black/0/rss.xml"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTo accomplish this, rather than add a cgi script to my site,		gopher.black	70
iI decided to add the RSS generation feature to burrow.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ burrow rss # generates the rss feed		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's also a config parameter to auto-generate RSS when writing		gopher.black	70
inew phlogs. Check out the man page or README.md to see more.		gopher.black	70

iNOTE: There's one little weakness of my RSS generator. It will		gopher.black	70
iorganize the most recent entries by date, but if you post multiple		gopher.black	70
ientries in a single day, it just alphabetizes them. I'm sure you		gopher.black	70
iguys can all deal with it.		gopher.black	70
