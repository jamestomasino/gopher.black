iLet me preface this by saying my snark here is entirely fictional		gopher.black	70
iand I have the greatest of respect for other people's hobbies...		gopher.black	70

iGeocaching is bullshit. Seriously? Let me poke in some numbers and		gopher.black	70
iwalk there and boom! a seeeeeecret thing. Tada! (play "Link gets		gopher.black	70
ithe triforce noise" in your head). Oh sure, there's clues to solve		gopher.black	70
ibut at the end of the day the whole physical aspect of going		gopher.black	70
isomewhere could be removed and replaced with a checkbox that says,		gopher.black	70
i"Yep, got it."		gopher.black	70

iNow letterboxing... that's the shit right there. None of this		gopher.black	70
ifancy schmancy technology. Instead, good old fashioned vague		gopher.black	70
ipioneer directions like, "Go west-north-west for 45 paces until		gopher.black	70
iyou near the tree that looks like an old man taking a piss."		gopher.black	70
iThat's some real adventure! Not the old man taking a piss, the		gopher.black	70
idire--you know what I mean. I love letterboxing. I will stamp the		gopher.black	70
ishit out of some letterboxes. I will leave hitchhikers along the		gopher.black	70
iway and have grand adventures in state parks. Mmmm, saucy hobby.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe reason I bring this up is not to bash geocaching (though that		gopher.black	70
iwas fun) but because Christy (who loves her some GPS) reminded me		gopher.black	70
iof an idea I had a while back for letterboxing which, I suppose,		gopher.black	70
icould be channelled for the dark arts in her hobby as well. My		gopher.black	70
iidea was to make a series of box challenges which led from one to		gopher.black	70
ithe other and eventually were all pieced together into an Uber		gopher.black	70
ichallenge. Not the car service kind, but like--you know what		gopher.black	70
iI mean.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe theme was cryptography, which I felt was fitting. The simplest		gopher.black	70
ibox used a Da Vinci cipher. The box then gave a piece of the		gopher.black	70
ipuzzle to the next clue which was an Arnold cipher. Then on to		gopher.black	70
ia straddling checkerboard. Then the big one was a VIC cipher. And		gopher.black	70
iwhen you took the pieces from all the boxes together and		gopher.black	70
iconcatenated all the strings you found, it would be a PGP key you		gopher.black	70
icould use to decode the final message to the final box.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI got as far as that and some basic clue planning, then I got hung		gopher.black	70
iup on where I wanted to hide the boxes and never got around to		gopher.black	70
idoing it. So, if you are out there and you letterbox, please go		gopher.black	70
iahead and steal my idea. I'd like to try and find your box		gopher.black	70
i(snicker). If you're a dirty geocacher, I guess you can do with it		gopher.black	70
iwhat you want... ugh.		gopher.black	70
