iI've been thinking about politics too much lately, so I thought		gopher.black	70
iI'd liven things up by jumping into economics! I'll keep this one		gopher.black	70
ishort, I promise.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm no fan of capitalism, especially "free" market economics. It		gopher.black	70
iis tantamount to slavery both in its literal abuse of the third		gopher.black	70
iworld or the consolidation of wealth into the corporate leading to		gopher.black	70
iwage-slavery in the first world. The appeal of endless growth is		gopher.black	70
iclear, but it's so obviously unsustainable that I can't keep up		gopher.black	70
ithe lie to myself. Eventually you will run out of peoples to		gopher.black	70
iexploit and the workers will have no money to spend. It will		gopher.black	70
iconsume itself or transform from economic oligarchy into political		gopher.black	70
ioligarchy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNo, the modern fascination with democracy is mirrored by the lust		gopher.black	70
ifor wealth that capitalism promises. In reality, the regulation		gopher.black	70
ithat free-market champions condemn are the very things that have		gopher.black	70
ikept us from the brink thus far. The world economy teeters on the		gopher.black	70
iedge of absolute ruin and it will be the greedy, get-rich-quick,		gopher.black	70
ithat take us all there.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere are alternatives, and they don't all involve us devolving		gopher.black	70
iinto an agrestic commune. Distributism [0] is my economic		gopher.black	70
istructure of choice. Here's the extremely brief key points:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - personal property is a right of the individual		gopher.black	70
i  - don't assign to higher association what lesser and subordinate		gopher.black	70
i    organizations can do		gopher.black	70
i  - small production and local culture is favored over central		gopher.black	70
i    systems and mass production		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  AKA, keep it small and owned by the workers.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe best examples I can give in today's culture are credit unions		gopher.black	70
iand farming co-ops.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOf course there's a lot more to it, and no system in place today		gopher.black	70
ifunctions in its pure form. We have some elements of distributism		gopher.black	70
iin the United States in the form of anti-trust laws. Still, I'd		gopher.black	70
iprefer more.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCapitalism has no soul, no morality. Distributism shares the		gopher.black	70
imorality of the community its attached to. I like that.		gopher.black	70
