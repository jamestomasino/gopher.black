iJust wanted to say that I really appreciate the arduino and other	
iawesome, friendly microcontrollers. I'm getting a subscription box	
ifrom Creation Crate and it's stretching me to think of new ways to	
iuse the device while also increasing my inventory. I just made	
ia memory game (like Simon). It was easy, but I never would have	
ithought to do it on my own. Next up is a distance detector which	
iI'm going to mod into a garage parking indicator.

iElectronics was fun back in the day, but now it's also easy.	
iThat's cool.
