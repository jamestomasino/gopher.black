iWhen cosmic voyage updated to ubuntu 20.04 subtle things broke		gopher.black	70
ithat I didn't notice right away. One of these was talk(1). We were		gopher.black	70
iusing ytalk(1) as the program of choice back in 18.10, but that		gopher.black	70
iseems to no longer be in apt. I reinstalled it from source and was		gopher.black	70
ihopeful that it would do the trick. Not so much.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI fought this for an hour tonight with a very patient voyager		gopher.black	70
ihelping me out. I tried closing out of mosh and tmux to narrow		gopher.black	70
idown the issue. Eventually I got a clue from the error message in		gopher.black	70
isyslog.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
italkd[411722]: 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1): unintelligible packet		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI had a lot of these messages and they eventually got me to		gopher.black	70
ia redhat bug report that suggested removing the inetd entry for		gopher.black	70
italkd would fix it. I commented that out and left the ntalkd line		gopher.black	70
iin place.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI also fixed a thing that bugged me from back in the day. The		gopher.black	70
inobody user had been configured to be a part of the tty group and		gopher.black	70
iI was using it in that inetd line. That felt dirty since nobody		gopher.black	70
ishouldn't have access to anything.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  sudo useradd -c 'in.talkd User' \		gopher.black	70
i  -d /nonexistent \ -s /usr/sbin/nologin \		gopher.black	70
i  -r -g tty talk		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo I added a 'talk' user, gave it the proper access, and swapped		gopher.black	70
iinetd to use that instead. Then I gave it a kick (restart the		gopher.black	70
iprocess) and things are working again. Whew!		gopher.black	70
