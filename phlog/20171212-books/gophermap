iI was thinking about Goodreads this morning and it occurred to me
ithat my book lists are probably available as RSS feeds. I took
ia look and I was right!
i
iI took my read books & currently reading books lists and fetched
ithem via curl and piped them to xmlstarlet to parse. I grabbed the
ibook names & authors, and output the results to a text file on my
igopher hole [0][1].
i
iI wanted to run this as a cgi originally. I got it all working to
istandard out, but on SDF, cgi's run with very little access to the
isystsem and xmlstarlet is not allowed. Instead I set up a cron to
irun my script each night at midnight. We'll see how that goes,
iI guess.
