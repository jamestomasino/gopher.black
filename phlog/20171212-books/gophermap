 I was thinking about Goodreads this morning and it occurred to me
 that my book lists are probably available as RSS feeds. I took
 a look and I was right!
 
 I took my read books & currently reading books lists and fetched
 them via curl and piped them to xmlstarlet to parse. I grabbed the
 book names & authors, and output the results to a text file on my
 gopher hole [0][1].
 
 I wanted to run this as a cgi originally. I got it all working to
 standard out, but on SDF, cgi's run with very little access to the
 systsem and xmlstarlet is not allowed. Instead I set up a cron to
 run my script each night at midnight. We'll see how that goes,
 I guess.
