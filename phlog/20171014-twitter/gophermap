 Twitter

 I deleted my Twitter account this week. It's been a decision I've
 been building up to for a while now. There's so many things that
 make me furious on there. Pretty much everything to do with
 American politics, the abuses of people of color and the LGBT
 community, women, Nazi bullshit, it just keeps going. The few
 moments of hilarity when a brand will respond to a person with
 a witty remark just don't balance the scales. 
 
 I met my wife on Twitter, via my best friend. I have^H^Hd a large
 community to draw on and engage with. I kept in touch with some
 people only via that medium. But, having left Facebook almost 10
 years ago, I realize that there's no real regrets in shedding
 a social network. The people who reach out to me in another way
 are the ones worthy of keeping in touch. The community I leave
 behind in one space will be matched by a new community elsewhere.
 
 Twitter is a cesspool of hate, of anger. It cannot police its own
 systems. It does not deserve to have my attention.
