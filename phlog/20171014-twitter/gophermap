iI deleted my Twitter account this week. It's been a decision I've
ibeen building up to for a while now. There's so many things that
imake me furious on there. Pretty much everything to do with
iAmerican politics, the abuses of people of color and the LGBT
icommunity, women, Nazi bullshit, it just keeps going. The few
imoments of hilarity when a brand will respond to a person with
ia witty remark just don't balance the scales. 
i
iI met my wife on Twitter, via my best friend. I have^H^Hd a large
icommunity to draw on and engage with. I kept in touch with some
ipeople only via that medium. But, having left Facebook almost 10
iyears ago, I realize that there's no real regrets in shedding
ia social network. The people who reach out to me in another way
iare the ones worthy of keeping in touch. The community I leave
ibehind in one space will be matched by a new community elsewhere.
i
iTwitter is a cesspool of hate, of anger. It cannot police its own
isystems. It does not deserve to have my attention.
