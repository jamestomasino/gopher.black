iYesterday was a big day for my text editor. Neovim 0.5 is about to		gopher.black	70
idrop into full release and it has integrated the language server		gopher.black	70
iprotocol (LSP) support natively. I went ahead and grabbed it ahead		gopher.black	70
iof release and spent the day resetting my config with the new		gopher.black	70
iplugins that take advantage of everything.		gopher.black	70

iDon't worry, this post isn't going to deep-dive into my config or		gopher.black	70
ianything. I just wanted to say how excited I am about LSP in		gopher.black	70
igeneral. What a fantastic idea it is to decouple the language		gopher.black	70
iinspection and tooling from the editor. As someone explained it,		gopher.black	70
ithe programmers who use neovim to program in javascript are only		gopher.black	70
ia subset of all javascript programmers. The same goes for VSCode,		gopher.black	70
ior any IDE or editor. Why fragment your efforts at better		gopher.black	70
ijavascript tooling by focusing on the specific tool. Better to		gopher.black	70
ibuild it as an API and let all the tools consume it.		gopher.black	70

iI also went in on a thing called telescope which does what I was		gopher.black	70
iusing FZF to do, but with a much prettier interface. It doesn't		gopher.black	70
iaffect too much of my coding ability (not like LSP) but it's		gopher.black	70
iaesthetically awesome and that has its place too.		gopher.black	70
