iGopher has been filled with threads on the topic of anonymity [0],		gopher.black	70
ibut I want to take a different tack. There's a storm brewing in		gopher.black	70
ithe form of Codes of Conduct for online communities. I have		gopher.black	70
iOPINIONS on these things, and the only appropriate place for		gopher.black	70
iopinion on the internet is hidden in dead protocols.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCodes of Conduct attempt to accomplish a GOOD. They attempt to		gopher.black	70
iensure that individuals are not exposed to unfair prejudice. This		gopher.black	70
iis a movement toward equality, which it itself is also a GOOD. (I		gopher.black	70
ihave argued in the past that I prefer liberty over equality, but		gopher.black	70
ithat is not a comparison of good vs bad, but rather a personal		gopher.black	70
istance on which is a greater good.) So far, we're all good here.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCodes of Conduct are also weapons. They are wielded by the		gopher.black	70
ioppressed and marginalized with a powerful blow aimed at those		gopher.black	70
ithey feel have transgressed. Is this a GOOD? Providing		gopher.black	70
ia reciprocal power dynamic is an expression of vengeance, not of		gopher.black	70
ijustice. It does not guarantee liberty or equality. It guarantees		gopher.black	70
ia shifted power-base and a new set of mores to be navigated, or		gopher.black	70
ielse. This is not good. This is bad.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHold off on the pitchforks. Go re-read the second paragraph again		gopher.black	70
iif you're getting steamy at me.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you're sitting there feeling like a Code of Conduct is a vital		gopher.black	70
itool in your arsenal as an objectified person, a minority, or		gopher.black	70
iother disenfranchised group member, I can totally understand why.		gopher.black	70
iIt's good to not be shit upon or taken advantage of. But at the		gopher.black	70
isame time, role reversal perpetuates a never-ending cycle of		gopher.black	70
ianger. "It's our turn," is the voice of a failed morality. It may		gopher.black	70
ifeel good, but it gives no high ground and it leads to more		gopher.black	70
isuffering for more people.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i(I'm skirting around going into some deeper ethics talk on the one		gopher.black	70
ihand, or going off into sci-fi territory and making a bunch of		gopher.black	70
iDune parallels, but I'm going to leave it alone and get to the		gopher.black	70
ipoint instead).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"So what, tomasino? If Codes of Conduct aren't the answer, what do		gopher.black	70
iyou think we should do?"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThanks for asking! First, I don't believe it is a necessity for		gopher.black	70
ia criticism to offer an alternative solution. It is okay to point		gopher.black	70
iout that something is wrong but not have a better alternative		gopher.black	70
iprepared. And guess what? I don't! I have a ridiculous alternative		gopher.black	70
ithat we most definitely SHOULD NOT DO. I'm going to share it with		gopher.black	70
iyou as a thought exercise.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's my idea: 100% enforcement of anonymity. Boom! Meritocracy		gopher.black	70
iblind to identity politics can only be 100% guaranteed if there is		gopher.black	70
ino identity to politic. Go ahead and create your company, your		gopher.black	70
ionline group. Share your code, grab commits and share and merge		gopher.black	70
iand whatever else technocrats do. But... no signatures. No names.		gopher.black	70
iNo personal sharing. You want an online identity, grab a number,		gopher.black	70
ior we'll pull a string of dictionary words and assign them to you.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow everyone is safe, has an equal voice and can be judged by		gopher.black	70
itheir own contributions. You want a code of conduct in the mix?		gopher.black	70
iI got you covered. It's got 2 rules:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1) If you share your identity, or provide information that		gopher.black	70
i   establishes a personal identity with the community, you're out.		gopher.black	70
i2) If you share another person's identity or personal details		gopher.black	70
i   about them, you're out.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis magical, mystical utopia actually sounds good to some people,		gopher.black	70
iI'm sure. But it's not. It overlooks the beauty of human		gopher.black	70
iinteractions and the infinite possibilities for the advancement of		gopher.black	70
iour species. It's an act of fear. Don't do it. Seriously, please		gopher.black	70
idon't do it. Also, cool it with the Codes of Conduct. Protect		gopher.black	70
ipeople, don't burn them.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd yes, Linus is an ass.		gopher.black	70

i[0] I was really going to go look these up, but then I got		gopher.black	70
idistracted. Take my word for it. There were a lot of posts on the		gopher.black	70
isubject earlier this year.		gopher.black	70
