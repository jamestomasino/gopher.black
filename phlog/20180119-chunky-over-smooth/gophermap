 Chunky over Smooth

 This phost is not about peanut butter,
 but about plain text.
 I recently read a blog post [0]
 shared by dbucklin [1]
 over on the #gopher channel on irc.sdf.org
 about writing text that breaks text 
 into chunks of semantic ideas or sentences.
 While it seems to make the text a bit longer
 it really does help with readability
 as well as version controll diffs
 and even editing.
 
 As I've been writing this phost
 I've been moving sentences around
 either in part or in whole.
 Having a period always at the end of a line
 and sentences always begin on a new line
 is remarkably helpful.
 There is a bit of a congative disconnect
 while I adjust to breaking up my text
 in a way that doesn't feel as natural
 as my writing style normally is,
 but that can be attributed to it being new
 and my forced attention on the style
 to ensure I'm doing it properly.
 Even now,
 as I end this second paragraph
 the technique is becoming more natural in flow.
 
 I'd like to know
 whether this format 
 makes things more difficult for you to read
 or makes it easier to scan.
 Please send me an email,
 a toot on mastodon,
 or a phlog reply
 with your thoughts.
 
 I see this as an easy way to
 author my markdown blogs,
 since the natural formatting of markdown
 will ride these paragarphs into a single block.
 Writing this way for drafts
 also makes a lot of sense.
 I'm really only concerned about
 using it in its broken--almost poetry-like--format
 in a medium like gopher
 where people will read it this way,
 or in my books
 where I will want to
 eventually refomat things into manuscript form
 with clear dialogue formatting
 and section breaks.
 
 I think I'll give this a try for a while.
