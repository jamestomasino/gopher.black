iThis phost is not about peanut butter,
ibut about plain text.
iI recently read a blog post [0]
ishared by dbucklin [1]
iover on the #gopher channel on irc.sdf.org
iabout writing text that breaks text 
iinto chunks of semantic ideas or sentences.
iWhile it seems to make the text a bit longer
iit really does help with readability
ias well as version controll diffs
iand even editing.
i
iAs I've been writing this phost
iI've been moving sentences around
ieither in part or in whole.
iHaving a period always at the end of a line
iand sentences always begin on a new line
iis remarkably helpful.
iThere is a bit of a congative disconnect
iwhile I adjust to breaking up my text
iin a way that doesn't feel as natural
ias my writing style normally is,
ibut that can be attributed to it being new
iand my forced attention on the style
ito ensure I'm doing it properly.
iEven now,
ias I end this second paragraph
ithe technique is becoming more natural in flow.
i
iI'd like to know
iwhether this format 
imakes things more difficult for you to read
ior makes it easier to scan.
iPlease send me an email,
ia toot on mastodon,
ior a phlog reply
iwith your thoughts.
i
iI see this as an easy way to
iauthor my markdown blogs,
isince the natural formatting of markdown
iwill ride these paragarphs into a single block.
iWriting this way for drafts
ialso makes a lot of sense.
iI'm really only concerned about
iusing it in its broken--almost poetry-like--format
iin a medium like gopher
iwhere people will read it this way,
ior in my books
iwhere I will want to
ieventually refomat things into manuscript form
iwith clear dialogue formatting
iand section breaks.
i
iI think I'll give this a try for a while.
