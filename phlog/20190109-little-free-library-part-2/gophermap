iI originally wrote part 1 of this build back in October [0] and		gopher.black	70
iI have a few little things to add.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFirst, I want to call out a major hurdle I'm facing: Captive		gopher.black	70
iPortal browsers don't allow users to download files. It's		gopher.black	70
ia security thing. That's annoying for a library that's designed to		gopher.black	70
igive you ebooks, but it might not be a barrier for your uses.		gopher.black	70
iSomeone on Mastodon mentioned making a video based thing, and that		gopher.black	70
ishould work just fine entirely in captive portal.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSecond, captive portal browsers are way behind the times with		gopher.black	70
iregard to css support. No CSS-Grid here, folks. Sadly I had to		gopher.black	70
ifall back on some older methods to make my page pretty.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSpeaking of pages, here's a link to the repository that houses my		gopher.black	70
iweb interface to the library [1].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you're reading this as of the moment of posting then you'll see		gopher.black	70
ithat I haven't addressed problem #1 yet. If you're finding this		gopher.black	70
ilater in time, hopefully it's all fixed for you. Here's my current		gopher.black	70
iplan of attack:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Create a very simple captive portal page that advertises the		gopher.black	70
i  little free library and instructs users to open a regular		gopher.black	70
i  browser and navigate to http://littlefreelibrary.local		gopher.black	70
i- The generated library page will be hosted at the root url, not		gopher.black	70
i  the captive-portal location, and will allow full downloads.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is going to take some testing to get right, but once it's all		gopher.black	70
isquared away I'll update that repo to contain both pages and		gopher.black	70
ideployment scripts.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFinally, I've purchased a solar battery that I'm going to try out.		gopher.black	70
iIt's a very basic solar charging battery pack of Amazon that I'm		gopher.black	70
inot going to bother linking. It's likely not the real solution		gopher.black	70
ihere since they're notoriously bad at actually charging from the		gopher.black	70
isun, and when they do they overheat and destroy the battery. But		gopher.black	70
iit will finish my proof of concept, and that's what's important.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOnce that arrives, I'll hopefully have time this weekend to give		gopher.black	70
ithe project one last push and get it working in the woods.		gopher.black	70
