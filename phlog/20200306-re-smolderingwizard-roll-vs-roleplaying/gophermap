iI just read a really interesting observational phlog post from		gopher.black	70
ismolderingwizard [0] on his experiences in a 5th edition D&D game.		gopher.black	70
iHe describes everything in 5th edition coming down to a mechanic		gopher.black	70
irole and that those rolls are happening constantly and distracting		gopher.black	70
ifrom the game.		gopher.black	70

iI've run into this in some games as well and feel it's ultimately		gopher.black	70
ithe fault of the DM/GM, though I can't judge them harshly for it.		gopher.black	70
iRunning a game is hard work and it's not a skill that's usually		gopher.black	70
itaught. People learn in their own way, from playing with others		gopher.black	70
iand emulating good GMs, or watching games online, or just doing		gopher.black	70
itheir best to guess their way through. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOne big influence these days is computer gaming. It's had immense		gopher.black	70
iimpact on tabletop RPGs over the years, going so far as to		gopher.black	70
icompletely screw up D&D into the mess that was 4th edition AKA		gopher.black	70
iWorld of Warcraft on paper. But even in the early days of say, 2nd		gopher.black	70
iedition, there were books and books describing mechanics that you		gopher.black	70
icould turn into rolls. I remember one guidebook describing the		gopher.black	70
ifall-off rate of light from various sized campfires and the impact		gopher.black	70
ifor low-light vision at each distance in a grid. It got silly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut those books didn't come from a vacuum. People wanted that in		gopher.black	70
itheir games. There's always been a subset of gamers who want the		gopher.black	70
imechanics to rule the action. Sometimes these are reflected in		gopher.black	70
ipower-gaming, or just optimized buildes. Sometimes it's just		gopher.black	70
ia style of play that the group enjoys.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI cannot put myself in that camp, personally. My most formative		gopher.black	70
ilong-term RPG was played 1-on-1 with my DM in high school. It was		gopher.black	70
ia solo game and we rolled almost never. The entire game was		gopher.black	70
irole-play and that has had enormous impact on my own style.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the Fate Core System book, the game designers have this to say:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  When to Roll Dice		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Roll the dice when succeeding or failing at the action could		gopher.black	70
i  each contribute something interesting to the game...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The worst, WORST thing you can do is have a failed roll that		gopher.black	70
i  means NOTHING HAPPENS--no new knowledge, no new course of action		gopher.black	70
i  to take, and no change in the situation. This is totally		gopher.black	70
i  boring...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  If you can't imagine an interesting outcome from both results,		gopher.black	70
i  then don't call for that roll. If failure is the uninteresting		gopher.black	70
i  option, just give the PCs what thy want and call for a roll		gopher.black	70
i  later, when you CAN think of an interesting failure. If success		gopher.black	70
i  is the boring option, then see if you can turn your idea for		gopher.black	70
i  failure into [a motivation for the PC to role play their		gopher.black	70
i  character that way]. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn combat things are simple. You failed a roll or you succeed at		gopher.black	70
iit have immediate consequences. If you're rolling as you walk down		gopher.black	70
ia hallway, what happens if you fail? You triggered a trap? But		gopher.black	70
iwhat if you succeed? Did you just notice the trap? That's boring		gopher.black	70
ibecause it doesn't change anything. What if the success meant you		gopher.black	70
ispotted a trap that was about to affect the party behind you. Your		gopher.black	70
iquick action let you spring up and grab a counterweight. Now you		gopher.black	70
ihave to hold it in place so the others can get across. The		gopher.black	70
ichallenge has changed the dynamic of the action and given the		gopher.black	70
iparty a reason to interact with one another. Is your character		gopher.black	70
istrong enough to hold it for the whole party? What if you this		gopher.black	70
isplits you up? What if you have to choose who to drop it on before		gopher.black	70
iyou're pulled inside the mechanism?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, I digress. Chat with your DM and talk about the rolls. Or		gopher.black	70
italk about it with the whole group. Are they into it? Maybe so.		gopher.black	70
iMaybe they're just waiting for the topic to come up.		gopher.black	70
