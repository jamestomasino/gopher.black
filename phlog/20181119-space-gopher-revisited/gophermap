iA while back I mused [0] about how some quantum mechanics mixed		gopher.black	70
iwith interstellar travel could create a scenario for text-based		gopher.black	70
icommunications to thrive, at least in fiction. Tonight the idea		gopher.black	70
icame back to me again. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've been hanging out with the tilde [1] crowd a lot lately, and		gopher.black	70
iit's so inspiring. I want to give back and make more of these		gopher.black	70
imicro-instance outposts that offer one thing really well. So many		gopher.black	70
ipeople have been phlogging about it recently, especially		gopher.black	70
isolderpunk [2]. How can I legitimately contribute, though? I don't		gopher.black	70
ithink I have the time or energy for a full tilde admin role. Plus,		gopher.black	70
ithere's already a bunch of these general purpose communities. What		gopher.black	70
iwould be unique about mine?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, then I began thinking about what motivates me and what I love.		gopher.black	70
iStorytelling is #1, especially role-playing games. Merge all that		gopher.black	70
itogether and it gives me such a great idea:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Humanity has expanded to the stars, but it wasn't in a single		gopher.black	70
i  great migration as many thought. Small communities and		gopher.black	70
i  individual families have drifted impossible distances away,		gopher.black	70
i  connected only through the thin tethers of a Quantum Entaglement		gopher.black	70
i  Communicator (QEC) which bridges their tiny bandwidth back to		gopher.black	70
i  this ancient relay hub. These are pen-pal letters, reports,		gopher.black	70
i  updates, cries for help, and calls into the darkness. What is		gopher.black	70
i  delivered to the system is unfiltered. Some of it is		gopher.black	70
i  intelligible. For some, common language has drifted too far for		gopher.black	70
i  clear translation. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The year is unimportant and irrelevant due to relativistic		gopher.black	70
i  travel. The only agreed upon date is the "now" of the QEC. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Launching sometime soon: A gopher-focused tilde community that		gopher.black	70
i  exists 100% in-game, sharing stories across the universe on the		gopher.black	70
i  only remaining free, interconnected network that unites the		gopher.black	70
i  dispersed peoples of the stars.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWould you participate?		gopher.black	70
