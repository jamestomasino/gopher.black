An introduction

This is my second time creating a gopher hole. I had one running
previously on an EC2 instance on Amazon before I had an epic screw-up that
hosed the box. I never bothered to write anything interesting in that
site. In fact, I think the entire site was just a copy of the Epic of
Gilgamesh.

This time around I'd like to do something better. I already have a blog
site at https://blog.tomasino.org and a labs blog where I write about
hacky stuff at https://labs.tomasino.org. I'm not sure if I'll put
a theme here or not. Maybe I can use it to document my side interests. One
thing I do know is that I'm not going to force myself into any strict
patterns or requirements. That way lies madness (or a lack of writing).
