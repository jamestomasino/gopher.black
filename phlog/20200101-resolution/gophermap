iI've got a little history [0,1] of making new years resolution		gopher.black	70
iposts on this phlog. I suppose I'll continue the trend. Three		gopher.black	70
iyears in a row makes it a tradition, wouldn't you say?		gopher.black	70

1[1] Resolution (2019)	/phlog/20181225-resolutions
i		gopher.black	70
iIn 2018 I resolved that I'd try to avoid time traps and spend time		gopher.black	70
ion things that matter. I picked up a few new hobbies and did		gopher.black	70
ipretty well with the effort. In 2019 I taught the phlogosphere		gopher.black	70
iabout my buddy's ridiculous resolutions and said that it would be		gopher.black	70
ithe year I was impeached. While I didn't manage to get impeached,		gopher.black	70
iat least someone did.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis year I haven't really been thinking about it much, so as the		gopher.black	70
ifireworks go BANG in the background I'll do some real-time		gopher.black	70
ipondering. Perhaps it might be a good opportunity to affect some		gopher.black	70
isort of ridiculous word usage, like 'whilst' or 'whomst'. That's		gopher.black	70
ipretty saucy, but is it resolution material? What about something		gopher.black	70
imore serious and purposeful, like de-googling completely. But one		gopher.black	70
iof my contract gigs uses Google apps for everything, so that's		gopher.black	70
iprobably out. I could pick one of my hobbies, like yarn spinning,		gopher.black	70
iand set a public goal. That might be good.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI should probably start with the silliness, though. Those come to		gopher.black	70
ime more easily anyway. Lets see... what's something that would be		gopher.black	70
iimpossible for me but is definitely attainable by SOMEONE. Hmmm...		gopher.black	70
iI've got it!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2020 will be the year Taylor Swift releases an album featuring ME!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPerfect. I'll just practice my hip-hop stylings by singing my own		gopher.black	70
iname over the start of her songs. This is gonna be bangin'.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs for a real resolution, I could stand to burn some weight, pray		gopher.black	70
imore, eat better, walk more. That's all a constant goal, though.		gopher.black	70
iIt doesn't need a special new year kickoff.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think 2020 will borrow some sentiment from 2018 and a bit from		gopher.black	70
iDune. This will be the year of my Butlerian Jihad, if you will.		gopher.black	70
iI don't want the computer to be my default place to hang out. As		gopher.black	70
imuch as I love you guys, it's an easy trap for me here in Iceland.		gopher.black	70
iI don't need to work to inculturate, practice my language skills,		gopher.black	70
ior any of that jazz. I am instantly connected to everyone and it's		gopher.black	70
itoo easy to let that fill my day.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo there it is, my 2020 Resolution is "Thou shalt not make		gopher.black	70
ia machine in the likeness of a human mind". In this case I'll use		gopher.black	70
ia (very) liberal interpretation of that to mean my own mind shall		gopher.black	70
inot be trapped by machines. (Yeah, yeah, I know that's not what it		gopher.black	70
imeans. Shuddup!)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNever fear, dear gopherites. I still work on the computer and will		gopher.black	70
isurely be around plenty even with this goal. It's inevitable.		gopher.black	70
