iI'll try to keep this to just 3 games as well (with an honorable		gopher.black	70
imention or two). Unlike cat, who favors the solo or two player		gopher.black	70
igames, I'm a fan of the epic.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. The Republic of Rome (Avalon Hill)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAvalon Hill is famous for making complex war simulation board		gopher.black	70
igames that take hours to set up, let alone play. It is a company		gopher.black	70
iat the forefront of destroying friendships. Diplomacy is probably		gopher.black	70
ithe game responsible for the most gamer-feuds in history, which		gopher.black	70
imakes Republic of Rome remarkable in that it was created		gopher.black	70
ispecifically for gamers who thought it too tame. Avalon Hill had		gopher.black	70
ia rating system for complexity in their games and at the time of		gopher.black	70
iits release, RoR was the first game to max it out. These days we		gopher.black	70
ican enjoy a few that have since jumped the shark in terms of		gopher.black	70
icomplexity [1].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[1] The Campaign for North Africa	URL:https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4815/campaign-north-africa
i		gopher.black	70
iFor all its ridiculous complexity and legal-code rulebook, it's		gopher.black	70
ia brilliantly fun game to tackle with a group of friends. The		gopher.black	70
iplayers control factions of senators in either the early, middle,		gopher.black	70
ior late republic time periods of Roman history. They struggle		gopher.black	70
iagainst one another for money, influence, popularity, and military		gopher.black	70
imight until one comes out dominant enough to meet one of several		gopher.black	70
ivictory conditions. But they must be careful! If the factions		gopher.black	70
idon't cooperate, Rome itself can fall and everyone loses.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis has been responsible for so many amazing nights of board game		gopher.black	70
ifun I can't sing its praises enough. As I'm gearing up to leave		gopher.black	70
ithe country, my friends here planned one last get together to say		gopher.black	70
ifarewell and what better way could they have done so than with		gopher.black	70
ia game of RoR.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. Carcassonne (Hans im Gl√ºck)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis tile-laying game is fast (20-30 min), easy-to-learn, and		gopher.black	70
iendlessly amusing. It's a great lunch-time game if you work with		gopher.black	70
ianother board game geek. You are building a sprawling city and		gopher.black	70
itrying to occupy the buildings you create to score points when		gopher.black	70
ithey are completed. You farm the lands servicing these buildings		gopher.black	70
iand set up monestaries. Oh, and don't forget to build roads! All		gopher.black	70
iof this is done with puzzle-like square tiles that connect and		gopher.black	70
iextend the existing city into a new crazy puzzle of awesome. Score		gopher.black	70
ikeeping is a little tricky at first, but it becomes second nature.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. Once Upon a Time: The Storytelling Card Game (AMIGO)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI adore storytelling and this game really scratches that itch.		gopher.black	70
iIt's a card-game with fantastic creatures and items all fantasy		gopher.black	70
ithemed. You will find character types like the witch, or princess,		gopher.black	70
iand items like magic swords. You'll also find story elements like		gopher.black	70
ia broken promise. With these building blocks you and your friends		gopher.black	70
iwill create an epic tale. Together. Entirely improv style.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe way it works is really cool. Someone starts telling the story.		gopher.black	70
iAs they tell their story they will begin to play cards in their		gopher.black	70
ihand that match the story they're telling. If they introduce		gopher.black	70
ia swarthy princess who runs an illegal footwear consortium, then		gopher.black	70
ithey may lay down the princess card. If that princess discovers		gopher.black	70
ia way to hide switch blades in the magical Air Jordans she's		gopher.black	70
icreating, then the player may play the magical sword card. But		gopher.black	70
iit's not as simple as just making up gibberish and laying down		gopher.black	70
iyour cards!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf the story fails to make sense, contradicts itself, or if the		gopher.black	70
iplayer pauses too long (as determined by the other players) then		gopher.black	70
ithe story moves to the next clockwise player and the previous		gopher.black	70
istoryteller must draw a new card to their hand for having "lost"		gopher.black	70
ithe story. There's also a tricky way to steal a story from		gopher.black	70
ia storyteller. If the storyteller mentions a story element that		gopher.black	70
imatches a card in your hand, you can play that card and take over		gopher.black	70
ithe story. But you better be ready to start right away or you may		gopher.black	70
ipause too long and lose it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAll of this storytelling and card playing/drawing is leading		gopher.black	70
itoward and ending that's unique to each player. You draw secret		gopher.black	70
iending cards at the start of the game. Your ending is different		gopher.black	70
ifrom the other players and you need to steer the narative in the		gopher.black	70
iright direction to get there. If your story ends with "The twins		gopher.black	70
iwere cooked in the pie." and the story doesn't even have twins		gopher.black	70
iintroduced, you have some catching up to do.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis game requires outgoing friends and benefits from some		gopher.black	70
imoderate drinking. It also has a special place in my game		gopher.black	70
icollection because of our house rule on "who goes first." 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNo matter what game we're playing, the choice of who goes first		gopher.black	70
icomes down to the Once Upon a Time deck. Everyone cuts the deck		gopher.black	70
iand takes out one card. Whichever card is "Closest to Unicorn"		gopher.black	70
igoes first. We love the ambiguity and determining whether the		gopher.black	70
iPrincess or the Magic Sword is closer to unicorn (magic sword,		gopher.black	70
iobviously). It starts every game out with a smile.		gopher.black	70

iHonorable Mentions:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA. Chess		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA classic, and I'm totally addicted, but it didn't feel right to		gopher.black	70
iinclude in this list.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iB. Tabletop RPGs		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPathfinder, D&D, Fate, The Riddle of Steel, Alternity, Fiasco, and		gopher.black	70
iall the rest are the very best games in the world. As much as		gopher.black	70
iI love a board game, a D&D campaign has no equal. I guess I'll		gopher.black	70
iprobably have to write more about that soon.		gopher.black	70
