iI just installed weechat-android on my phone and boy are my arms		gopher.black	70
itired. Wait, no... I mean, boy was that easy! 		gopher.black	70

iI set up a relay:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i/secure set relaypass yourmom		gopher.black	70
i/set relay.network.password "${sec.data.yourmom}"		gopher.black	70
i/relay add weechat 9001		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThen I opened up port 9001:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
isudo ufw allow 9001		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThen I went into my router and port forwarded 9001 to gopher.black		gopher.black	70
i(which runs my weechat).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI downloaded the app from the play store like a heathen (it's on		gopher.black	70
if-droid too, or direct from github). Opened up the configuration		gopher.black	70
isettings, clicked connect, and nothing worked!!!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThen I closed the app, reopened it, and boom! Everything was fine.		gopher.black	70

iThe interface is great. Very intuitive for swiping around. If		gopher.black	70
iyou're an IRC junky and use weechat, check it out.		gopher.black	70
