iI adored this band when I was a teen. They were local and played		gopher.black	70
imostly in bookstores and small venues or the occasional folk		gopher.black	70
ifestival. I would see them as much as possible, listened to their		gopher.black	70
imusic around the clock... you get it.		gopher.black	70

iWell, 20+ years later, the keyboardist and main songwriter was		gopher.black	70
istuck at home due to covid-19. He sat at his piano and started		gopher.black	70
iplaying a song that he'd forgotten all about. It was from the time		gopher.black	70
ileading up to their second indy album but the feel wasn't right		gopher.black	70
ifor that collection. Much later on he thought he'd lost all traces		gopher.black	70
iof it: gone from memory and never recorded. Here we was, just		gopher.black	70
ibarely remembering the tune.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThen serendipity struck. Today he dusted off an old, ancient iPod		gopher.black	70
iand plugged it in. Amazingly it still worked. He put it on shuffle		gopher.black	70
iwith his collection of thousands of songs when what should start		gopher.black	70
icoming through his speakers but the very mystery song he'd lost.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSometime in the mid-nineties he had put together a demo track with		gopher.black	70
ijust him and the lead singer. One take, no practice. It had been		gopher.black	70
imis-labeled as a different track ("More to This") and tossed into		gopher.black	70
ia collection and forgotten.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iToday it speaks across time not just to him, but to all of us who		gopher.black	70
iloved that music and the band, and to everyone who spends the time		gopher.black	70
ito listen. I can't even put into words how much it means to me.		gopher.black	70
