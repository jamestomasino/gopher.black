iThis is mostly directed at solderpunk.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI was thinking on AV-98 and VF-1 and how they're so wonderfully		gopher.black	70
isimilar. It would be so neat to have a single client that could		gopher.black	70
ibrowse gopher & gemini protocols seemlessly, and they're kinda the		gopher.black	70
iperfect place to start that thought.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut then I was thinking, "Oh, it would be terrible to start your		gopher.black	70
ijourney thinking you're on Gemini and safely using TLS only to		gopher.black	70
imove into Gopher without realizing it and be unprotected." But if		gopher.black	70
ithere was a way to differentiate between the modes, sort of like		gopher.black	70
i"battle mode" that visually indicated you were TLS protected, then		gopher.black	70
ithings would be better.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI thought about the way I've got my vim status bar configured to		gopher.black	70
ichange color when I'm in insert vs normal modes and thought about		gopher.black	70
ithat in VF1. One color for "secure" one color for "unsecure".		gopher.black	70
iThat'd be neat, right? And what about onion addresses? VF-1 works		gopher.black	70
iquite well over tor, and onion addresses provide end-to-end		gopher.black	70
iencryption. So they could be safely grouped in the "secure" block,		gopher.black	70
ior maybe get a third color.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd that's great for knowing where you are, but not where you're		gopher.black	70
igoing. Colorizing links with matching colors would help indicate		gopher.black	70
iyour options.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut then again, not everybody like colors, so maybe a prefix on		gopher.black	70
ilinks or the bar like an "@" or a "!" or something? Or maybe		gopher.black	70
ithat's a configuration option.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, it's a whole bunch of thoughts about somebody elses code		gopher.black	70
iand clients and not my place at all to direct, but I thought I'd		gopher.black	70
ishare my thinking in case it inspires anything in you.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCheers!		gopher.black	70
