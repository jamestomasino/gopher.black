iTonight I set up resource limits on cosmic. Specifically I set up		gopher.black	70
iCPU and Memory limits for users. I don't get a lot of bad eggs		gopher.black	70
iamongst the voyagers, but it's easy to take a bigger slice of the		gopher.black	70
ipie than you intend on a tiny tilde. Someone had a newsreader		gopher.black	70
irunning tonight that was accidentally using the entire 1024MB		gopher.black	70
iI have to offer.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI wasn't sure how to set this up, so I did a little research and		gopher.black	70
ifor once systemd came to the rescue. Here's what I did:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i----		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
imkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
icat > /etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d/50-memory.conf << EOF		gopher.black	70
i[Slice]		gopher.black	70
iMemoryMax=80M		gopher.black	70
iCPUQuota=8%		gopher.black	70
iEOF		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
isudo vim /etc/systemd/system.conf		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i# uncomment and set the following values in that file:		gopher.black	70
iDefaultCPUAccounting=yes		gopher.black	70
iDefaultMemoryAccounting=yes		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
isystemctl daemon-reload		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i----		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd that's it! I may tweak those quota values over time to make		gopher.black	70
isure the system stays healthy but people can still use it. So far		gopher.black	70
iso good.		gopher.black	70
