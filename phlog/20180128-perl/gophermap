 Perl

 I guess it's about time I bite the bullet and learn perl. Michael
 Conrad posted a link to his blog [0] about his absolutely
 incredible car project where he's designed a custom dash that's
 actually a little linux machine. He's done just about everything 
 in perl 5 and opened my eyes to some of its power.
 
 I've always thought of perl as a write-only (because the syntax is
 so dumb) glue language. Since I'm so comfortable with shell
 scripting, it seemed like an unnecessary step to take. It seems
 that some of that syntax has gotten better, and the way it
 interacts with c is pretty cool. Availablity on a huge range of
 systems is a plus.
 
 I found a few decent quickstart guides. I'll give this a go.
