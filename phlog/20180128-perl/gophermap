iI guess it's about time I bite the bullet and learn perl. Michael
iConrad posted a link to his blog [0] about his absolutely
iincredible car project where he's designed a custom dash that's
iactually a little linux machine. He's done just about everything 
iin perl 5 and opened my eyes to some of its power.
i
iI've always thought of perl as a write-only (because the syntax is
iso dumb) glue language. Since I'm so comfortable with shell
iscripting, it seemed like an unnecessary step to take. It seems
ithat some of that syntax has gotten better, and the way it
iinteracts with c is pretty cool. Availablity on a huge range of
isystems is a plus.
i
iI found a few decent quickstart guides. I'll give this a go.
