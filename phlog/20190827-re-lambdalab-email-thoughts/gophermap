iThe lambda lab wrote [0] about setting up email and asked for some		gopher.black	70
ithoughts on relaying that mail to others around gopherspace. I do		gopher.black	70
isomething like that on cosmic.voyage. Namely, I have installed and		gopher.black	70
ienabled postfix to allow for outbound emails only to specific		gopher.black	70
ihosts. [1,2] Since I'm targeting other tildes and not big email		gopher.black	70
iproviders I don't need to worry about ending up on spam lists		gopher.black	70
ibecause of unauthenticated emails to Biggy-G. It also means I can		gopher.black	70
ibe lazy about it.		gopher.black	70

iIf you're using the host yourself and not sharing it with others		gopher.black	70
ithen you don't even need to go that far. Just be selective about		gopher.black	70
iwho you email, I guess.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut honestly, setting up DKIM, SPF, etc, isn't too bad these days.		gopher.black	70
iThe hard part is dealing with the Notorious-G and others		gopher.black	70
iblacklisting you because they don't care, forcing you to manually		gopher.black	70
iintercede and get clearance. The last time I dealt with that with		gopher.black	70
ithem I had to do a bunch of extra crap to figure out how to see		gopher.black	70
ithe error message that had some obscure URL they wanted me to		gopher.black	70
ivisit. Yuck.		gopher.black	70
