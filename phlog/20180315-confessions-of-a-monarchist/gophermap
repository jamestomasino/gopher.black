iConfessions of a Monarchist

iI don't normally talk about politics, but I'll make one brief	
iexception tonight. You see, I don't vote. I make an active choice	
iin that. Right about now people tend to try to figure out what	
isort of party alignment I have. I'll save you some time, it's not	
ion the radar. 	
i	
iI don't want to participate in democracy. I refuse to participate	
ias an active member in the republic. I'm a monarchist.	
i	
iYou, my gopher friends, are not like the seething masses out	
ithere. You've shown proclivities for the Antisocial Media	
iManifesto [0], for living of the grid [1], for searching for	
ifreedom from oppressive legislation [2] also known as liberty. You	
iare like me in many ways, and so I feel okay sharing my secret	
iwith you. I believe democracy is a guaranteed path to ruin in the	
iform of dictatorship via demagogy.

iMy preference is for a world of individual liberty over all other	
ithings. Your preference may be different, but if you can	
iunderstand my point of view you can understand my arguments for	
imonarchy as a superior form of government. I will spare you the	
idetails beyond a very simple observation that to enforce equality	
i(not equity, as in the Christian virtue) the state must exercise	
ipowerful controls that limit liberty. Democracy must, by its	
inature, promote equality and thus limit liberty.	
i	
iIf you are not thoroughly bored by the topic already, I'll leave	
iit there and suggest a fantastic book that will explain it so much	
ibetter than I could [3] by a brilliant author. [4] His views were	
ia lot more conservative than mine are, but we agree on the state	
iof democracy.

iA single leader can make decisive choice and remain above the	
iwills of the mob who exercise their preference for envy over	
iutopian brotherhood. That's part of what I believe in, and why	
iI just keep my damned mouth shut about it. 	
i	
iJesus, that turned into a rant. Sorry 'bout that!
