iI don't normally talk about politics, but I'll make one brief		gopher.black	70
iexception tonight. You see, I don't vote. I make an active choice		gopher.black	70
iin that. Right about now people tend to try to figure out what		gopher.black	70
isort of party alignment I have. I'll save you some time, it's not		gopher.black	70
ion the radar. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI don't want to participate in democracy. I refuse to participate		gopher.black	70
ias an active member in the republic. I'm a monarchist.		gopher.black	70

iYou, my gopher friends, are not like the seething masses out		gopher.black	70
ithere. You've shown proclivities for the Antisocial Media		gopher.black	70
iManifesto [0], for living of the grid [1], for searching for		gopher.black	70
ifreedom from oppressive legislation [2] also known as liberty. You		gopher.black	70
iare like me in many ways, and so I feel okay sharing my secret		gopher.black	70
iwith you. I believe democracy is a guaranteed path to ruin in the		gopher.black	70
iform of dictatorship via demagogy. 		gopher.black	70

iMy preference is for a world of individual liberty over all other		gopher.black	70
ithings. Your preference may be different, but if you can		gopher.black	70
iunderstand my point of view you can understand my arguments for		gopher.black	70
imonarchy as a superior form of government. I will spare you the		gopher.black	70
idetails beyond a very simple observation that to enforce equality		gopher.black	70
i(not equity, as in the Christian virtue) the state must exercise		gopher.black	70
ipowerful controls that limit liberty. Democracy must, by its		gopher.black	70
inature, promote equality and thus limit liberty.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you are not thoroughly bored by the topic already, I'll leave		gopher.black	70
iit there and suggest a fantastic book that will explain it so much		gopher.black	70
ibetter than I could [3] by a brilliant author. [4] His views were		gopher.black	70
ia lot more conservative than mine are, but we agree on the state		gopher.black	70
iof democracy.		gopher.black	70

iA single leader can make decisive choice and remain above the		gopher.black	70
