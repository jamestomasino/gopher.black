iIn the early days of the web I had a site called A Film A Day.		gopher.black	70
iWhy, oh, why, did the Internet Archive fail to archive it, I shall		gopher.black	70
inever know. For about 5 years I kept up a practice of watching (on		gopher.black	70
iaverage) one film per day and reviewing it. Of course I didn't		gopher.black	70
iwatch something every single day, so I'd bank by watching a few on		gopher.black	70
ithe weekends and so on. The important part wasn't getting my		gopher.black	70
iyearly quota, though. I was on a mission to prove a point in an		gopher.black	70
iargument I'd had at a diner.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i                      Every movie is a		gopher.black	70
i                      five star movie		gopher.black	70
i                      if you watch it		gopher.black	70
i                      the right way.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat was my angle, you see. My reviews weren't about giving		gopher.black	70
iratings to the films. It was all about figuring out how to watch		gopher.black	70
ithem to get the most enjoyment. I managed it, too! with a few		gopher.black	70
inotable exceptions (no one can get 5 stars from Battlefield		gopher.black	70
iEarth).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou need an example? Let's take the unfortunate film, Alien Vs.		gopher.black	70
iPredator. What should have been a bloody affair was hamstrung by		gopher.black	70
ia PG-13 rating and a setting so isolated in the arctic that		gopher.black	70
inothing really felt at stake. But... twist it in your mind and let		gopher.black	70
iit become the greatest video game trailer of all time and entire		gopher.black	70
istory now has purpose and drive.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSometimes that's all it takes. Just tweak your mind a little bit		gopher.black	70
iand see things from another angle and it's awesome! Other times it		gopher.black	70
itakes much more work. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've been thinking on the Star Wars films and how I might approach		gopher.black	70
ithem so they're enjoyable. I think the best angle might be through		gopher.black	70
icompassion. I imagine the filmmakers as a kid in high school who		gopher.black	70
iadores this fandom. He eats up everything he can about the		gopher.black	70
itheories and fan-fiction. He lives his life so deep in it that he		gopher.black	70
iforgets there are casual fans. There are people who watched the		gopher.black	70
imovies once and then moved on. There is no place left in his world		gopher.black	70
ithat hasn't been taken over with esoteric knowledge of this		gopher.black	70
iimagined universe.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe feel a little sorry for that kid and wish he could enjoy		gopher.black	70
isomething else, something more. But we know, also, that he gets		gopher.black	70
isuch joy from this that we feel for him and want him to experience		gopher.black	70
iit where he can.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd so, these other Star Wars movies are his. They are not part of		gopher.black	70
ithe series. They are not "real". The universe bestowed a gift upon		gopher.black	70
ithat nerd and let him use real actors and studios to produce his		gopher.black	70
iopus of fandom. It is filled with false nostalgia and fan theories		gopher.black	70
ijumbled up into a hodgepodge. It is not there to make sense. It is		gopher.black	70
inot there to complete a great epic. It is a fulfillment of		gopher.black	70
ia nerd's dream, and we can compassionately enjoy it with him.		gopher.black	70
