iI finally got around to setting up twtxt! [0]
i
iI didn't install the utility yet. I was more concerned with
iwriting microblogs than reading them for now. I knew I wanted to
ihost it on my sdf site, which is hosted on meta (ma.sdf.org).
iI also knew I wanted to be able to author the microblog from any
iof my servers. It's not as robust as the phlog, so I shouldn't
ineed to log in somewhere specific with a bunch of environment
ivariables or scripts or anything. Here's what I've got:
i
i  #!/usr/bin/env bash
i  
i  twt(){
i    local TWTXT=${TWTXT:-"/meta/www/t/tomasino/twtxt.txt"}
i  
i    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
i      read -ep 'Message: ' input
i      if [ ! -z "$input" ]; then
i        echo -e "`date -Im`\t$input" >> "$TWTXT"
i      else
i        echo "No message. Abort."
i      fi
i    else
i      echo -e "`date -Im`\t$@" >> "$TWTXT"
i    fi
i  }
i  
i  meta="ma.sdf.org"
i  host=$(hostname)
i  
i  if [ $host != $meta ]; then
i    ssh -t tomasino@ma.sdf.org twt "$@"
i  else
i    twt "$@"
i  fi
i
iIt's not super clean or polished, but it works. If I'm not on
imeta, it ssh's to ma silently and runs the twt script on the right
iserver. I can either 1-line it or I can just run the command and
ihave it prompt me for my message. Then it's a simple append to the
ifile with the datestamp and done.
i
iI guess I'll link it on the phlog? I'll have to figure out what
iI want to do about reading other people's twtxt's too. I think
iI need to write my own phlog aggregator before that, though.
