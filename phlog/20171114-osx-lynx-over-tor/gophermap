iOSX lynx over tor

iThe fine gentlemen on #freenode's gopher channel were showing off
isome of their gopher sites served over tor. I wanted to test it
iout while I was at work on my MacBook Air. This machine wasn't
iconfigured to use tor at all, so here's the process I went through
ito get everything working. (It's really easy)
i
iStep 1: Install tor and torsocks and lynx if you don't have them
i
i  brew install tor torsocks lynx
i
iStep 2: Use this wrapper [0] to launch tor and create the proper
inetworking configuration to use the socks proxy, and disable that
iproxy when you kill tor.
i
i  #!/usr/bin/env bash
i
i  # 'Wi-Fi' or 'Ethernet' or 'Display Ethernet'
i  INTERFACE=Wi-Fi
i
i  # Ask for the administrator password upfront
i  sudo -v
i
i  # Keep-alive: update existing `sudo` time stamp until finished
i  while true; do sudo -n true; sleep 60; kill -0 "$$" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &
i
i  # trap ctrl-c and call disable_proxy()
i  function disable_proxy() {
i      sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE off
i      echo "$(tput setaf 64)" #green
i      echo "SOCKS proxy disabled."
i      echo "$(tput sgr0)" # color reset
i  }
i  trap disable_proxy INT
i
i  # Let's roll
i  sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxy $INTERFACE 127.0.0.1 9050 off
i  sudo networksetup -setsocksfirewallproxystate $INTERFACE on
i
i  echo "$(tput setaf 64)" # green
i  echo "SOCKS proxy 127.0.0.1:9050 enabled."
i  echo "$(tput setaf 136)" # orange
i  echo "Starting Tor..."
i  echo "$(tput sgr0)" # color reset
i
i  tor
i
iStep 3: Use torify to launch lynx
i
i  torify lynx gopher://hg6vgqziawt5s4dj.onion/1/
i
iYour tor service should run fine as-is for browser usage, but it
ilooks like you'll need to use torify if you want to launch
ia command line app that uses tor. This "just works" for me, so
ihopefully it will for you as well.
i
iNext up, solving this for Linux!
