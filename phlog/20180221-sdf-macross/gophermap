iSDF Macross

i
iI joined SDF in August of 2017 and I haven't yet found the time to
iwatch Macross. As a Meta-ARPA member, that feels like some sort of
icrime. Well, I acquired a copy of the show and I'm kicking it off
itonight.
i
iI've mentioned before that I'm not much of an Anime fan in
igeneral. My common complaints are that the characters all seem to
italk too much and don't leave anything unsaid. Also, the rants and
imonologues all tend to sound like they have the same "voice", not
ithat of the character. And finally, there's rarely any subtlety.
iOf course there are exceptions here and there, but that's been my
ioverall opinion of the genre. I'm hopeful that Macross will find
iits way into the select group of shows and movies that I enjoy.
i
iWish me luck, and as cat said on Mastodon today: 
i
iSEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...
