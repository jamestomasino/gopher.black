 SDF Macross
 February 21st, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I joined SDF in August of 2017 and I haven't yet found the time to
 watch Macross. As a Meta-ARPA member, that feels like some sort of
 crime. Well, I acquired a copy of the show and I'm kicking it off
 tonight.
 
 I've mentioned before that I'm not much of an Anime fan in
 general. My common complaints are that the characters all seem to
 talk too much and don't leave anything unsaid. Also, the rants and
 monologues all tend to sound like they have the same "voice", not
 that of the character. And finally, there's rarely any subtlety.
 Of course there are exceptions here and there, but that's been my
 overall opinion of the genre. I'm hopeful that Macross will find
 its way into the select group of shows and movies that I enjoy.
 
 Wish me luck, and as cat said on Mastodon today: 
 
 SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY...
