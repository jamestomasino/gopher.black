iI converted my Mint laptop from KDE to i3 today based on some
ihelpful feedback on Mastodon. I had no idea that it was so easy to
iinstall another window manager and swap between them. All you have
ito do is install the package, log out, and log back in!
i
iAnyway, i3 [0] is a fantastic minimalist window mananger that
itreats all your windows pretty much like tmux or screen treats
iterminals. You can split vertically, horizontally, resize, shift,
ilaunch things to different workspaces, etc. There's a ton of
iconfiguration you can do to really make it yours, but it's pretty
istellar with the defaults. I changed a few of the key mappings
iaround, added a screensaver and that's about it.
i
iI also messed with systemd and put my suspend settings in when
iclosing the laptop lid. I've wrapped up screensaver and i3lock to
imake a cool minimal lock-to-resume thingy. Basically I feel like
ia wizard. All hail my basic linuxing!
