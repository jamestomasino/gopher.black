 i3

 I converted my Mint laptop from KDE to i3 today based on some
 helpful feedback on Mastodon. I had no idea that it was so easy to
 install another window manager and swap between them. All you have
 to do is install the package, log out, and log back in!
 
 Anyway, i3 [0] is a fantastic minimalist window mananger that
 treats all your windows pretty much like tmux or screen treats
 terminals. You can split vertically, horizontally, resize, shift,
 launch things to different workspaces, etc. There's a ton of
 configuration you can do to really make it yours, but it's pretty
 stellar with the defaults. I changed a few of the key mappings
 around, added a screensaver and that's about it.
 
 I also messed with systemd and put my suspend settings in when
 closing the laptop lid. I've wrapped up screensaver and i3lock to
 make a cool minimal lock-to-resume thingy. Basically I feel like
 a wizard. All hail my basic linuxing!
