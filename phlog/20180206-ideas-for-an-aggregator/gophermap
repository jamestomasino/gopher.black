iIdeas for an aggregator
iFebruary 06th, 2018
i----------------------------------------
i
iI want to build a new gopher aggregator, specifically for phlogs,
iand I want it to work in a very particular way. I'm not sure this
iis going to be a general solve for everyone, but if I can do it
iright it will work for my personal use.
i
iVersion 1 Plan:
i
i  - It should know that a phlog has been updated, not a whole
i    gopherhole.
i
i    - I should provide it an array of gophermaps to keep track of.
i
i    - The gophermap will be hashed each day--store the hashes in
i      a file for simplicity, or a sqlite db-- and if the hash
i      changed from the previous day, that link is added to the
i      daily list.
i
i    - If the link doesn't resolve, ignore. It might be temporary.
i
i  - It should organize phlog updates by date so I can go back if
i    I missed a couple entries (like Bongusta)
i
i  - It should auto-update daily
i
i  - Output should be simple:
i
i    - Master gophermap is a symlink to the current month.
i
i    - Each gophermap is a year-month for easy archival
i
i    - Viewing the directory will list the archive and current
i
i    - Linking to current will include a link to the archive
i      (directory view)
i
iVersion 2 Plan:
i
i  - The link added to the aggregated list should point to the new
i    entry, not the main gophermap. 
i
i    - Potentially do a diff on the gophermap if the hash has
i      changed and try to identify new links?
i
i    - Grab any new links and drop them in verbatim, potentially
i
i      - Relative links might need to be rewritten
i
i      - Problems with changed links?
i
i    - Would this be instead of linking to the map, or in addition
i      (sub links under a heading?)
i
i    - Allow a way for people to submit their phlog to the list and
i      make it a public system instead of a private aggregator
i    
iMy plan was to implement this in Perl as a way to learn Perl.
iI may still go ahead with that, but it might be easier for me to
ibuild with my current knowledge in python. Regardless, if anyone
ireading this wants to take a stab at it, go right ahead. I'd
irather have the tool than be the one to write it.
