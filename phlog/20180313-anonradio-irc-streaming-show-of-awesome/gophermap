iIRC chat comes to life as an anonradio show!		gopher.black	70
i(Credit to cat for giving me the idea [0])		gopher.black	70

iHow it could work:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  1. An IRC bot sits in #anonradio on sdf. (Theoretically it could		gopher.black	70
i     be done on com, where there is more talky traffic for		gopher.black	70
i     anonradio, but I have no idea how to interface with it)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  2. When the show goes live, anonbot takes the text each user		gopher.black	70
i     says and pipes it into "say" using a different unique voice		gopher.black	70
i     styling for each user. Here it would be nice to assign some		gopher.black	70
i     voices to more regular speakers. I'm not sure how many voices		gopher.black	70
i     say has available.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  3. Vocal streams are sent up to anonradio's stream via		gopher.black	70
i     liquidsoap or whatever other client can handle it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  4. We all laugh and type silly things at each other for an hour		gopher.black	70
i     and let the robots speak for us.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow for the challenges:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  1. I have no idea how to program an IRC bot. I think I just saw		gopher.black	70
i     a post about it on Lobste.rs though, so I can go fishing for		gopher.black	70
i     that.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  2. I don't have an anonradio show. SNOWDUSK, PLAES HALP [1]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  3. I barely have any understanding or capability with liquidsoap		gopher.black	70
i     or any other streaming software. It seems like it should be		gopher.black	70
i     trivial to have an empty stream going that just waits to pipe		gopher.black	70
i     in "say" stuff, but I've got no idea where to start. Anyone		gopher.black	70
i     out there know any better?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  4. No one talks in #anonradio. Maybe that would change if there		gopher.black	70
i     were a bot that made you sound silly on the internet?		gopher.black	70

iThe challenges aren't insurmountable but I'd welcome help. Hell,		gopher.black	70
iI'd welcome someone else swooping in and building the whole thing.		gopher.black	70
iI really just want to participate. ;)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat say you, Gophers? Is this worth making a thing?		gopher.black	70
