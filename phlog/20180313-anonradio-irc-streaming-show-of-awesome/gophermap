iAnonradio IRC Streaming Show of Awesome
iMarch 13th, 2018
i----------------------------------------
i
iIRC chat comes to life as an anonradio show!
i(Credit to cat for giving me the idea [0])
h[0] cat's thread on Mastodon	URL:http://mastodon.sdf.org/@Cat/99678752422294369
i
iHow it could work:
i
i  1. An IRC bot sits in #anonradio on sdf. (Theoretically it could
i     be done on com, where there is more talky traffic for
i     anonradio, but I have no idea how to interface with it)
i
i  2. When the show goes live, anonbot takes the text each user
i     says and pipes it into "say" using a different unique voice
i     styling for each user. Here it would be nice to assign some
i     voices to more regular speakers. I'm not sure how many voices
i     say has available.
i
i  3. Vocal streams are sent up to anonradio's stream via
i     liquidsoap or whatever other client can handle it.
i
i  4. We all laugh and type silly things at each other for an hour
i     and let the robots speak for us.
i
iNow for the challenges:
i
i  1. I have no idea how to program an IRC bot. I think I just saw
i     a post about it on Lobste.rs though, so I can go fishing for
i     that.
i
i  2. I don't have an anonradio show. SNOWDUSK, PLAES HALP [1]
i
i  3. I barely have any understanding or capability with liquidsoap
i     or any other streaming software. It seems like it should be
i     trivial to have an empty stream going that just waits to pipe
i     in "say" stuff, but I've got no idea where to start. Anyone
i     out there know any better?
i
i  4. No one talks in #anonradio. Maybe that would change if there
i     were a bot that made you sound silly on the internet?

i
iThe challenges aren't insurmountable but I'd welcome help. Hell,
iI'd welcome someone else swooping in and building the whole thing.
iI really just want to participate. ;)
i
iWhat say you, Gophers? Is this worth making a thing?
