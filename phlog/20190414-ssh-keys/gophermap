iI'm listening to Go Go Penguin's tiny desk concert [0] right now		gopher.black	70
iwhile I type this little phlog. You should join me if you can.		gopher.black	70
iThey're incredible. 		gopher.black	70

iYesterday I got snookered into starting up a new tilde [1] server		gopher.black	70
icalled tilde.black. My reasoning was pretty simple: gopher.black		gopher.black	70
iis literally the only .black TLD site I know. I can't have someone		gopher.black	70
ielse starting tilde.black! It must be me.		gopher.black	70

iSo I was going to spin up a general purpose thing in Ubuntu 18.04		gopher.black	70
icause that's what I know best, but again I let myself get talked		gopher.black	70
iinto doing more. So, the machine is running OpenBSD 6.4. It's		gopher.black	70
igoing to be focused on privacy, anonymity, and security once		gopher.black	70
iI open her up to new members. And I was close today! I had web		gopher.black	70
i& gopher set up, lets encrypt all configured, tor worked on web,		gopher.black	70
igopher and even SSH. All was glorious. But then something wonky		gopher.black	70
ihappened with rcctl and a forum post I read recommended tossing		gopher.black	70
isome config line in place and restarting the box. Big. Mistake.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo it didn't come back up and now I'm starting over. This time		gopher.black	70
iaround though I wanted to give some time and consideration to my		gopher.black	70
issh keys and how I'm managing all that gibberish. One thing led to		gopher.black	70
ianother and Michael W. Lucas's SSH Mastery book kept slapping me		gopher.black	70
iin the face. The way I had my keys set up was criminally simple		gopher.black	70
iand insecure. I needed to do something before I launch a project		gopher.black	70
iwith security in the goals.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, I bit the bullet and dove in to posts on ssh-agent and using		gopher.black	70
igpg-agent to interface with ssh and a host of other things. I can		gopher.black	70
inow say with the confidence of a person who skimmed web pages for		gopher.black	70
ian hour that all that shit needs some work. In fact, I hope it's		gopher.black	70
isomething the community on tilde.black will do eventually. There		gopher.black	70
ishould be simple guides for new people on these topics. There		gopher.black	70
ishould be examples, recommendations, watch-outs, and more. Instead		gopher.black	70
ithere's aging stack-exchange posts with scripts that throw errors		gopher.black	70
iin modern ssh-agent, hordes of contradictory blog posts, and		gopher.black	70
iworse. This is fundamental stuff for terminal work, guys! We can		gopher.black	70
ido better. The knowledge is in our circle, lets share it, okay?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the meantime I did what I always do. I said "eff it, I'll roll		gopher.black	70
imy own solution with a shell script". And I did! You can see it		gopher.black	70
iover here [2] if you want. Here's the gist:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  1) Every service gets its own ssh key. Period. 		gopher.black	70
i  2) Every ssh key gets a password. 		gopher.black	70
i  3) These passwords are not all the same thing. 		gopher.black	70
i  4) Simple script to enable/disable the keys when I need them		gopher.black	70
i     without having to memorize all the passwords.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[2] lssh	URL:https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/lssh
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat I wrote is a wrapper around Lastpass, the password manager		gopher.black	70
iI use. Lastpass has a cli tool called lpass which is great.		gopher.black	70
iI added entries in Lastpass for each of my ssh keys' passwords,		gopher.black	70
iplaced them into a sync folder using Spideroak (my preferred		gopher.black	70
isecure sync solution) and made an easy shell wrapper to activate		gopher.black	70
iwhichever one I need. The activated key goes into ssh-agent. I can		gopher.black	70
ieasily clear ssh-agent with ssh-add -D, so that didn't need any		gopher.black	70
ispecial wrapping (though I may add a quick switch to my script		gopher.black	70
ianyway for that purpose). It's all very basic stuff, again, but it		gopher.black	70
iworks well and brings me closer to "safe" for my threat level.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'd like to clean the script up more and put some bells & whistles		gopher.black	70
ion it, but that will come with time.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNext week it's back to the grindstone at work, but after Friday		gopher.black	70
iI have a week off. My mother-in-law is in town and there's some		gopher.black	70
ithings I really need to focus on for the move, though, so this		gopher.black	70
ibreak probably won't mean great investments of time into tildes or		gopher.black	70
ieven writing on Cosmic Voyage. There's a couple more months of		gopher.black	70
ithis ahead, and then craziness once we arrive in Iceland.		gopher.black	70
iHopefully I'll be slowing down a notch or two mid-August. :)		gopher.black	70
