iA few people on mastodon requested a little guide on how to set up		gopher.black	70
istunnel4 with gophernicus to offer TLS. As you might know from my		gopher.black	70
iearlier posts on gopher.black, I prefer to run this gopher server		gopher.black	70
ias a tor service instead of using the TLS approach alone since it		gopher.black	70
idoes all the same things plus some extra goodies and doesn't		gopher.black	70
irequire modification to your gopher clients. Regardless, gopher		gopher.black	70
iover TLS is cool in its own right (and I use it on cosmic.voyage).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's how:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1) Make sure you're using gophernicus and it's Kim's Prison		gopher.black	70
i   Edition, not one of the ancient ones that shows up when you		gopher.black	70
i   google gophernicus, like prologic's		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2) Have an SSL cert. I use letsencrypt because why pay for		gopher.black	70
i   something that's free?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3) Have stunnel4. I think it was an apt install for me.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iActually configuring everything is just a matter of tweaking		gopher.black	70
i2 files:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1) /etc/default/gophernicus		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOPTIONS="-o UTF-8 -nt -nh -nf -T 7070"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe important part for TLS is the last bit (-T PORT). The other		gopher.black	70
iswitches hide the /stats page which is a security issue, and get		gopher.black	70
irid of titles and footer and stuff, which make for a cleaner		gopher.black	70
irendered gophermap. They're cool settings, but not necessary for		gopher.black	70
iTLS.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2) /etc/stunnel/gophernicus.conf		gopher.black	70

i; Gophernicus behind Stunnel4 for gopher over TLS		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
i; User/group for stunnel daemon		gopher.black	70
isetuid = stunnel4		gopher.black	70
isetgid = stunnel4		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i; PID file location		gopher.black	70
ipid = /var/run/stunnel4/gophernicus.pid		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i; Log to file, not syslog		gopher.black	70
ioutput = /var/log/stunnel4/gophernicus.log		gopher.black	70
isyslog = no		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i; Certificate in pem format is needed for TLS		gopher.black	70
icert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/cosmic.voyage/fullchain.pem		gopher.black	70
ikey = /etc/letsencrypt/live/cosmic.voyage/privkey.pem		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i; Enable TCP wrappers		gopher.black	70
ilibwrap = yes		gopher.black	70
iservice = in.gophernicus-tls		gopher.black	70

i; Gopher over TLS service		gopher.black	70

iconnect = 127.0.0.1:70		gopher.black	70
iprotocol = proxy		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo I'm pointing at my letsencrypt cert for cosmic in this file,		gopher.black	70
iand I've chosen to use port 7070 for TLS. Kensanata says there's		gopher.black	70
ian argument for port 7443 that was given on the gopher mailing		gopher.black	70
ilist, but I never read it. Use what makes sense to you, but make		gopher.black	70
isure it matches what you have in /etc/default/gophernicus.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd that's it. Oh, I guess you'll need to open up your port with		gopher.black	70
iyour firewall, but everything else should just work(TM).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iGood luck!		gopher.black	70
