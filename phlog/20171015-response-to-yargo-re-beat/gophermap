iYargo, I totally agree about the problems with Swatch Internet
itime. It  frustrates me because I built a metric-time
iimplementation in high school a few years before Swatch did their
ithing, and I was so proud of it. Then Swatch came and squished my
icool teenage thing.
i
iIn mine, 1 day was 1 unit. The epoch was unix epoch--because it
iwas easy--aligned with GMT, with no time zones or daylight
isavings. I called it a quant (this part was cheesy) and deciquants
ior DQ counted through a 100 intervals of the day (about 14.4
iminutes). Days were just integer counters without respect to year
ior month or season or anything. I thought that those should be
idescriptors you could add on, like weather. Later I'd think of it
iin terms of metadata. Datetime as one float. 
i
iRegardless, Swatch Internet time was close to a cool idea. I do
irespect that they got rid of timezones. They never really
iaddressed dates, just time, so that's short sighted too. I guess
iI don't have a lot of faith in the crazy mechanisms of a watch
icompany.
