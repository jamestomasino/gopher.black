 Yargo, I totally agree about the problems with Swatch Internet
 time. It  frustrates me because I built a metric-time
 implementation in high school a few years before Swatch did their
 thing, and I was so proud of it. Then Swatch came and squished my
 cool teenage thing.
 
 In mine, 1 day was 1 unit. The epoch was unix epoch--because it
 was easy--aligned with GMT, with no time zones or daylight
 savings. I called it a quant (this part was cheesy) and deciquants
 or DQ counted through a 100 intervals of the day (about 14.4
 minutes). Days were just integer counters without respect to year
 or month or season or anything. I thought that those should be
 descriptors you could add on, like weather. Later I'd think of it
 in terms of metadata. Datetime as one float. 
 
 Regardless, Swatch Internet time was close to a cool idea. I do
 respect that they got rid of timezones. They never really
 addressed dates, just time, so that's short sighted too. I guess
 I don't have a lot of faith in the crazy mechanisms of a watch
 company.
