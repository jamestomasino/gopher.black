iI must be 30% magpie or something because I can't steer clear of		gopher.black	70
ishiny new things no matter how hard I try. In this case, the shiny		gopher.black	70
i"new" thing isn't so new at all, but is a programming language		gopher.black	70
ifrom 1980 (when I was born). Ada [0] is a brilliant language. It's		gopher.black	70
iincredibly simple, syntactically, but also extremely powerful. It		gopher.black	70
imakes conscious decisions to forgo speed and brevity in exchange		gopher.black	70
ifor safety and clarity. It is cautious where other languages are		gopher.black	70
ibold.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's a "hello, world" example:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iwith Ada.Text_IO;		gopher.black	70
iprocedure Hello is		gopher.black	70
i  use Ada.Text_IO;		gopher.black	70
ibegin		gopher.black	70
i  Put_Line("Hello, World!");		gopher.black	70
iend Hello;		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEverything is spelled out. Every instruction ends with		gopher.black	70
ia semicolon, everything is case insensitive, variables must be		gopher.black	70
ideclared between the "is" and "begin" of a procedure. Every		gopher.black	70
ibeginning has an explicit end, which is labeled. It's so		gopher.black	70
iridiculously cautious!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI told ~ben the other day that it's the Tigran Petrosian [1] of		gopher.black	70
iprogramming languages. The whole mentality is so neat to me.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's a lot of languages out there and I don't need to learn		gopher.black	70
ithis one. While it's true that I haven't kept up with any		gopher.black	70
isystems-programming languages it's not really a gap in my		gopher.black	70
iknowledge. It's just that I have no need of them since I don't do		gopher.black	70
ithat type of work. So why learn something that's best suited to		gopher.black	70
imassive government builds? Cause FUCK YOU, I wanna!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iLook forward to seeing a bunch of shell work done in Ada in the		gopher.black	70
inear future. I was going to make Cosmic Voyage's web generation		gopher.black	70
iscript in python instead of continuing to grow the massive /bin/sh		gopher.black	70
iscript, but maybe I'll tackle it in Ada instead.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHas anyone out there ever used it for web programming before? That		gopher.black	70
itickles me pink!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnywho, any of you know and use Ada? I learned the basics in		gopher.black	70
icollege but have never done anything worth a damn in it. I found		gopher.black	70
ia bunch of resources online including a standards site with the		gopher.black	70
imost Orwellian name ever: Ada Conformity Assessment Authority [2].		gopher.black	70
iHah! So badass. They're serious about following conventions with		gopher.black	70
iit, which really makes sense for the applications it serves. PEP8		gopher.black	70
iis similar for python. If you feel like diving in with me, here's		gopher.black	70
ia link to a crash-course in the form of a ~40pg PDF [3]. I'm going		gopher.black	70
ito store my practice programs and notes in a git repo [4].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow, lets see if I can do this without cutting into my Icelandic		gopher.black	70
ipractice, or my writing on this phlog, or on Cosmic Voyage, or my		gopher.black	70
ipreparations for the upcoming move, or planning my wife's 50th		gopher.black	70
ibirthday party (SEEEECRET) or any of the other things that are		gopher.black	70
iactually important which I should be focusing on instead.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
