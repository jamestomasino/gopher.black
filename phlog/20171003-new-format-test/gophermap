iIn this phlog entry, I've changed my type to 1 instead of 0--that
iis I've moved my entry to a gophermap instead of a text file.
iThis allows me to make links in the file. I'm going to do that in
ia footnote pattern, like I've been doing in my text entries. That
ishould avoid breaking things visually.
i
iThis first entry I'm building by hand as a way of discovering all
ithe different things I'll need to tweak to make this work. The
ifirst is obviously that I'll be creating a folder for entries
iinstead of a single text file. That will break my "Phlog Stream"
ioption, so I'll likely remove it for the short term. The next
ichange I'm making is changing my textwidth to 69 instead of 80.
iI did 66 instead of 67 because I'm going to add a blank space
icharacter in the front of every line in the document before the
ilinks footer. That should avoid any problems with accidentally
istarting a line with a number and having it interpretted as
ia gophermap menu item. I think I'll author everything normally
iand handle that extra space with a sed [0] command in my script.
i
iThe links in the footer are interesting. I'm not sure there's
ia good way to automate those. I added a reference to sed in the
iparagraph above in the link style I was using before. Maybe I'll
iprefix the link word or phrase in the footer with the
icooresponding number for reference. That should be enough
icontext.
i
iAdding the entry to the gophermap seems no harder than before.
iHonestly, this is going to be pretty simple to do, and should
ihelp my rendering on phones and small screens. 67 characters is
ithe gopher spec, so I should try to stick to it.
i
iWhat do you all think? Is there anything else I could do to make
ithis format work better? It's a lot to change in my generator
ijust to support links, but I think it'll be really nice to be
iable to not only reference other people's phlogs but link to the
ientries as well.
