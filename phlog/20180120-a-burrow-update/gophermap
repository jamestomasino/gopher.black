 A burrow update
 January 20th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I'm very happy with the way burrow is turning out. I've learned
 a lot about man files and how to properly install bash completion
 files. 
 
 It think the later is going to be a little problematic if this
 scales beyond my personal use. I don't trust my methods for
 determining where to install the bash completion files, and
 there's no error checking at all. I'll add an issue for myself on
 that front.
 
 Regardless, things are working well. I'll try to use it for a week
 or two and hammer it from different angles:
 
   - I'm using it on sdf.org as part of a cronjob to update my
     gopher repo using the 'update-git' action. This should allow
     me to post from any machine using burrow and the content will
     make its way to production within an hour.
 
   - I'm using it on SDF's meta array and my home laptops to add
     content from different operating systems and different
     configurations. So far so good.
 
 I've put a few issues on github for myself as a roadmap of
 improvements. If any of you are interested in this thing and want
 some special feature, just say the word.
