iA burrow update
iJanuary 20th, 2018
i----------------------------------------
i
iI'm very happy with the way burrow is turning out. I've learned
ia lot about man files and how to properly install bash completion
ifiles. 
i
iIt think the later is going to be a little problematic if this
iscales beyond my personal use. I don't trust my methods for
idetermining where to install the bash completion files, and
ithere's no error checking at all. I'll add an issue for myself on
ithat front.
i
iRegardless, things are working well. I'll try to use it for a week
ior two and hammer it from different angles:
i
i  - I'm using it on sdf.org as part of a cronjob to update my
i    gopher repo using the 'update-git' action. This should allow
i    me to post from any machine using burrow and the content will
i    make its way to production within an hour.
i
i  - I'm using it on SDF's meta array and my home laptops to add
i    content from different operating systems and different
i    configurations. So far so good.
i
iI've put a few issues on github for myself as a roadmap of
iimprovements. If any of you are interested in this thing and want
isome special feature, just say the word.
