iFirst let me offer my condolences to tfurrows for the loss of		gopher.black	70
ia long phlog post. [0] Your loss is also ours.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSecond, let me suggest a slight modification to your workflow:		gopher.black	70
i- Generate a tmp-file for authoring		gopher.black	70
i- Process tmp-file in a secondary stage for formatting		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf the formatting fails, you still have your temp file.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAlternatively, vim will save everything you type to a swap-file as		gopher.black	70
iyou type it, and preserve undo states. Come to the dark side.		gopher.black	70
