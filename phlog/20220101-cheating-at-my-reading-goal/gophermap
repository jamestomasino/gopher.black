iA new year is here and a new reading goal is set. I'm sticking		gopher.black	70
iwith my goal of 100 books like the last few years. It's attainable		gopher.black	70
ieven if I hit a slump. Even so, to start my year off on a good		gopher.black	70
inote I like to read easy, quick stuff. Last year I read like 10-15		gopher.black	70
ibooks of this Witch P.I. series that's honestly pretty terrible,		gopher.black	70
ibut I just tear through it. It helps that the books are cozy as		gopher.black	70
ihell and nothing serious is ever at stake more than a knitting		gopher.black	70
icontest.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis year I was thinking about what series to binge to get ahead.		gopher.black	70
iI'm just getting started on the Jill Kismet series (I have the		gopher.black	70
iwhole thing in an omnibus). I also have the Alex Verus series of		gopher.black	70
iwhich I've read book one and will likely binge quickly. But		gopher.black	70
iinstead of either of those I realized that my Calibre library has		gopher.black	70
ipage numbers in it (because I'm diligent about good data). So...		gopher.black	70
iI'm going to sort by shortest book and clean house on a bunch of		gopher.black	70
inovellas I've been sitting on for years. I have about 20 books		gopher.black	70
iunder 50 pages! If I want to read a bunch of the Shadow stories		gopher.black	70
ithis year I could do my entire 100 and stay under 150 pages each.		gopher.black	70
iWild! Such cheating! Hahaha.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'll mix it up soon enough and I don't stop at 100 books, so I'm		gopher.black	70
inot really cheating anything. This is just a little mental trick		gopher.black	70
ito help me feel like I'm well invested in reading for the year. My		gopher.black	70
iown motivation wanes if I fall behind schedule and it becomes		gopher.black	70
iincreasingly hard to pick up my Kindle. It's best to stay well		gopher.black	70
iahead of goal.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, here I go!		gopher.black	70
