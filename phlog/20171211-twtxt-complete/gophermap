iI installed twtxt on ma.sdf.org today. It was easy. I just used
ivirtualenv-3.6 to set up a nice ecosystem, then did the pip
iinstall method in the documentation. After install I ran the
iquickstart. It asked to overwrite my twtxt.txt file (which I had
ibacked up) but it turns out it didn't mess with it at all. All
igood there!
i
iNext I found a list of people to follow as a starting point on
igithub [0]. I forked the repo and added a pull request to add my
iname to the list which was promptly accepted (whee!). Installing
ithose folks is an easy one-liner at the bottom of the readme.
i
iFinally, I didn't want to have to log into ma.sdf.org every time
iI wanted to check my timeline, so I added a little alias:
i
i  alias twtxt='ssh -t meta twtxt timeline'
i
iI have a ssh alias for meta array in my ssh config, so that
ihandles it all in one line nicely. Oh! I had to edit the config
ifile for twtxt to set the display order to ascending instead of
ithe default descending so that the newest messages are at the
ibottom. Now I don't need to worry about passing it to a pager to
isee the latest.
i
iThere's a #twtxt channel on freenode. I informed them of my
istream, but I haven't seen any responses yet. @elw also set up his
iown twtxt stream, so it's already paying off!
i
iI have no idea if I'll stick with it or if it'll end up having
ia different feel from Mastodon, but what the hell. It's plain text
iand that's awesome.
