 twtxt complete
 December 11th, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I installed twtxt on ma.sdf.org today. It was easy. I just used
 virtualenv-3.6 to set up a nice ecosystem, then did the pip
 install method in the documentation. After install I ran the
 quickstart. It asked to overwrite my twtxt.txt file (which I had
 backed up) but it turns out it didn't mess with it at all. All
 good there!
 
 Next I found a list of people to follow as a starting point on
 github [0]. I forked the repo and added a pull request to add my
 name to the list which was promptly accepted (whee!). Installing
 those folks is an easy one-liner at the bottom of the readme.
 
 Finally, I didn't want to have to log into ma.sdf.org every time
 I wanted to check my timeline, so I added a little alias:
 
   alias twtxt='ssh -t meta twtxt timeline'
 
 I have a ssh alias for meta array in my ssh config, so that
 handles it all in one line nicely. Oh! I had to edit the config
 file for twtxt to set the display order to ascending instead of
 the default descending so that the newest messages are at the
 bottom. Now I don't need to worry about passing it to a pager to
 see the latest.
 
 There's a #twtxt channel on freenode. I informed them of my
 stream, but I haven't seen any responses yet. @elw also set up his
 own twtxt stream, so it's already paying off!
 
 I have no idea if I'll stick with it or if it'll end up having
 a different feel from Mastodon, but what the hell. It's plain text
 and that's awesome.
