iI had a good time swimming this afternoon. I got into a good		gopher.black	70
iheadspace for the first time in months and was able to just go and		gopher.black	70
inot pay attention to lap count or even time. That's a great		gopher.black	70
ifeeling because I can push myself further and my brain starts to		gopher.black	70
icrave going more. It's the cycle of action and activity that		gopher.black	70
iusually helps anchor me in overall healthier habits.		gopher.black	70

iLast year I had a really good run until we started hitting		gopher.black	70
ilockdowns and the pools closed. That killed my momentum and set me		gopher.black	70
iback. Summer is here, though, and the mixture of the vitamin D and		gopher.black	70
iphysical activity is doing wonders. Soon I'll get back into hiking		gopher.black	70
iin the evenings as well. (I usually swim in the morning.)		gopher.black	70

iOne of my favorite things to do while swimming is let my mind		gopher.black	70
iwander on writing projects or role playing games. I'm running one		gopher.black	70
iPathfinder game that was the focus of today's mind wanderings.		gopher.black	70
iI think I came up with two good hooks for the next session and		gopher.black	70
isome excellent flavor. I'll leverage what I came up with today to		gopher.black	70
ibuild up some scene prompts that I can toss in my box-o-tricks.		gopher.black	70
iI don't want to railroad this group but instead encourage them to		gopher.black	70
ihave full power of choice to impact the world around them as they		gopher.black	70
isee fit. It's a boring game to just say, "You're in a town, what		gopher.black	70
ido you do?" however. I'll have two major hooks to draw them in		gopher.black	70
icertain directions as motivation and then a collection of		gopher.black	70
inarrative encounters and challenges I can mix and match to		gopher.black	70
isprinkle throughout. It'll be glorious.		gopher.black	70

iI can't wait to get back underwater tomorrow and continue thinking		gopher.black	70
ion it.		gopher.black	70
