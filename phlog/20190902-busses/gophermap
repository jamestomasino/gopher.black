iI never spent much time on busses growing up. We were a car family		gopher.black	70
iin the suburbs. I either rode my bike places or we drove a car.		gopher.black	70
iNothing was accessible by foot, and busses didnt run close by.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iUpon moving to Reykjav√≠k we decided to go without a car for the		gopher.black	70
ifirst year to save money and get to know the area more intimately.		gopher.black	70
iIt forces me to walk place to place, which is exercise I need, and		gopher.black	70
iit slows the pace of life.		gopher.black	70

iToday I wanted to buy new 3D filament. I've only found one store		gopher.black	70
ithat sells it so far, and it took me almost two hours to get there		gopher.black	70
iand make the purchase with all the transfers. A single errand is		gopher.black	70
ia day's outing. 		gopher.black	70

iEven now as I'm on the bus home I feel a strange reaction from		gopher.black	70
icompleting a simple task. It reminds me of the pleasures of the		gopher.black	70
iSlow Internet.		gopher.black	70

iMy wife went grocery shopping this morning. She walked the 2 km		gopher.black	70
iinto town (down a big hill and up another) then shopped and rode		gopher.black	70
ithe bus home. She accomplished something more significant than it		gopher.black	70
iwould have been by car.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is all of mind due to the convergence of solderpunk's		gopher.black	70
iROOPHLOCH and kensanata's thread on creating, or rather the notion		gopher.black	70
iof being productive. It seems to me that the method contributes so		gopher.black	70
imuch to the worth that I'm not sure end products are of much use in		gopher.black	70
idetermining quality of time spent.		gopher.black	70

iAnother case in point, sewing. I routinely did the sewing in our		gopher.black	70
ilast home by machine. It gave satisfaction for creation, but since		gopher.black	70
imoving all my needle work has been by hand. It took me an hour to		gopher.black	70
imake finger puppets for my son, but the satisfaction scaled more		gopher.black	70
irapidly than the increased effort. Some of that may be novelty, but		gopher.black	70
ithe same could be said for the machine.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWorking manually by choice gives strange fruit.		gopher.black	70
