iIt's ROOPHLOCH time, right? I'm pretty sure that's in september.		gopher.black	70
iWell, I hope so, cause this is a ROOPHLOCH post!		gopher.black	70

iI recently bought a cabin [0] and this weekend is the first the		gopher.black	70
ifamily is spending in it. My wife is up on the mountain behind us		gopher.black	70
iright now exploring some of the sheep trails that lead through the		gopher.black	70
isaddle. We hear there's a rumor of a mountain lake back there.		gopher.black	70
iBelow me sits the valley lake and river. Off in the far distance		gopher.black	70
ito the south is Esja, the largest mountain in the capital region		gopher.black	70
ihere in Iceland.		gopher.black	70

iI'm on mobile internet here. I think that, together with the		gopher.black	70
iremoteness of the place warrants a ROOPHLOCH post. We have		gopher.black	70
ielectricity and clean water utilities, but I also have a cistern		gopher.black	70
ifed by the mountain creek that runs through the property which is		gopher.black	70
iused to handle all the outside water needs: garden, mostly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's a super cozy place, and very quiet. I took an 8 second		gopher.black	70
iexposure photo last night of the valley and still saw nothing but		gopher.black	70
idarkness. It gets proper dark here, which is going to be excellent		gopher.black	70
ifor aurora viewing. It's also really great and inspiring for		gopher.black	70
iwriting. The remoteness gives a quietude that lets the mind race		gopher.black	70
iwith ideas. I'm going to put it some effort on the Solarpunk		gopher.black	70
iPrompts podcast [1] in a little bit.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[1] Solarpunk Prompts	URL:https://podcast.tomasino.org
i		gopher.black	70
iThat series is coming to a close soon. I've got 7 or 8 more		gopher.black	70
iprompts lined up to write about and then record, and then I'll		gopher.black	70
iclose it down as complete. But I'm not done talking about		gopher.black	70
iSolarpunk. I want to do something new on the subject. Maybe		gopher.black	70
ia discussion piece where I can interview people. Ideas are still		gopher.black	70
ipercolating. I think the place I can be most helpful to the cause		gopher.black	70
iis in awareness, so interviews that amplify the voices of people		gopher.black	70
imaking Solarpunk a reality today would be the best. But ideas are		gopher.black	70
icheap. It's the doing that's hard. So lets see if I actually get		gopher.black	70
ithis one off the ground.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think my track record for "getting stuff done" is pretty good.		gopher.black	70
iI'm not perfect at it. I had a zine idea that never really got		gopher.black	70
ianywhere, after all. But cosmic still exists, and tilde black had		gopher.black	70
ia good run. The podcast is real, and CYOA ran until a legal		gopher.black	70
itake-down. That's all in my favor. Sometimes I feel like I'm not		gopher.black	70
ireally doing anything, though. I guess it's that whole comparison		gopher.black	70
ias the death of joy thingy. We can't all stand up in the face of		gopher.black	70
icat's creations. :)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh, non-sequitor: do you all know a good way to cut down on flies?		gopher.black	70
iThe cabin has a lot of water sources nearby and a pretty large		gopher.black	70
iamount of native plants surrounding. The sunroom attracts flies		gopher.black	70
iand they eventually make their way inside. It's not at problem		gopher.black	70
ilevels, but I'd like to minimize it. The former owner has a bug		gopher.black	70
izapper and some fly paper out there, but I'm not sure if that		gopher.black	70
ihelps or just attracts more. Isn't there something you can pour		gopher.black	70
iinto stagnant water? or is that for mosquitos? We don't have those		gopher.black	70
ihere (yay). Anyway, advice welcome.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's it for now. I'm gonna go use this fancy-ass espresso maker		gopher.black	70
ithat came with the place and make a cappucino and sit on the deck		gopher.black	70
iwith my Dashiell Hammett book. Enjoy, gophs.		gopher.black	70
