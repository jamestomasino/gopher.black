iYears ago there was a series of videos on youtube that outlined		gopher.black	70
ithe deep, deep secrets and strategies of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out in		gopher.black	70
iexquisite detail. The series was quite long, if memory serves.		gopher.black	70
iPerhaps 10 or 12 videos in all. I remember it from the late 2000s		gopher.black	70
ibut it seems to have vanished from the internet completely.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the first of the videos the author explained some of the		gopher.black	70
ifundamentals. These are things we take for granted about the game		gopher.black	70
ithat are so basic they set up the mind for later revelations. The		gopher.black	70
ifirst can be demonstrated by a very basic question: which punch		gopher.black	70
idoes more damage, left or right? Do you know? Do you think you		gopher.black	70
ihave an answer? Or did you, like most people, just punch whichever		gopher.black	70
iwas convenient and then alternate away? Would you be surprised to		gopher.black	70
ilearn that there is an actual benefit for choosing one over the		gopher.black	70
iother. There is indeed, and it depends upon which direction your		gopher.black	70
iopponent attacked from last.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe sequence of punching, whether to stay on left or right for		gopher.black	70
ia series or to alternate, also changes depending on a number of		gopher.black	70
icues that are all right there in the game. There's so much at		gopher.black	70
iwork, such rich programming and strategy, that it's unfathomable		gopher.black	70
ithat it's escaped notice for so long.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat else can I tell you about? The various techniques to gain		gopher.black	70
istars, the methods of using those stars that results in opponent		gopher.black	70
ireactions you've never even seen. Seriously, there's like 10		gopher.black	70
ivideos worth of gold that was out there!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut now it's gone. Poof. I've looked a bunch of times without any		gopher.black	70
iluck. The author pulled the videos down and vanished long ago and		gopher.black	70
ino manner of sleuthing has uncovered a crumb.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's contrary to the idea we're normally presented with that once		gopher.black	70
isomething is on the internet it's there forever. We gopher		gopher.black	70
idwellers know the truth, though. This is all vapour and fleeting.		gopher.black	70
iHow much of the web was purely in Flash and completely		gopher.black	70
iinaccessible now? How much was never archived in the wayback, or		gopher.black	70
iwas behind a login? My own earliest websites are gone. And that's		gopher.black	70
ijust the web! How much of gopherspace is lost to us? These		gopher.black	70
iprotocols, around in force since the mid 90s only, 25-30 years of		gopher.black	70
icontent that seems at once like everything that has ever been, and		gopher.black	70
ialso a flash in the pan. How long until the next technological		gopher.black	70
iupheaval closes another door to our past? How long until all of		gopher.black	70
ithis is fleeting memory?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe are better at archiving than many here in our burrows. It's		gopher.black	70
imostly plain text, after all, and easily stored. But it's also		gopher.black	70
idifficult to index, and links vanish without a clue as to where		gopher.black	70
ithose backup treasure troves might be. If we lose a few		gopher.black	70
icornerstones like Cameron's Floodgap, or SDF, how much goes with		gopher.black	70
iit?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, I guess what I'm saying is... have any of you seen the		gopher.black	70
iPunch-Out videos? I really want to watch them again.		gopher.black	70
