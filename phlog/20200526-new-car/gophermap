iA funny thing happened to me on Saturday. I went to a lovely BBQ		gopher.black	70
iwith some friends in Reyjkavík and had to head home around 2300 in		gopher.black	70
iorder to catch the last bus from the capital out to my little		gopher.black	70
isuburb. The bus picked me up and deposited me there 20 minutes		gopher.black	70
ilater as planned. While I was on the bus, I took out my kindle to		gopher.black	70
ido some reading.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen I got off that bus I needed to make one transfer onto the #7		gopher.black	70
ibus which would take me into my neighborhood, saving me a 1km walk		gopher.black	70
ifrom the town center. I've done this many times and knew the bus		gopher.black	70
iwould be along any moment, so I kept reading. As expected, the bus		gopher.black	70
icame around the corner and up the hill toward me. I hopped on and		gopher.black	70
ikept reading.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSee, here's where things get a little silly. I may have been		gopher.black	70
ipretty drunk at this point owing to said BBQ earlier in the		gopher.black	70
ievening. I was most certainly not paying attention as I was		gopher.black	70
ireading. I also forgot completely that the number 7 bus travels in		gopher.black	70
iboth directions from the same bus stop I was at. I usually would		gopher.black	70
icheck the exact timing of the bus because there's no way to tell		gopher.black	70
ifrom the signage whether it's headed to my neighborhood or away		gopher.black	70
ifrom it. In fact, during that last nightly route both busses		gopher.black	70
iappear at that stop within two minutes of one another.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo yeah, I was a little surprised when I looked up to find myself		gopher.black	70
iin another town and not in my neighborhood. I was screwed. Ugh.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere were no more busses and taxis don't just wander the streets.		gopher.black	70
iYou need to call them and arrange a pickup. So what's a drunk guy		gopher.black	70
ito do in this situation? If you guessed "walk 10km home around		gopher.black	70
ia mountain in the middle of the night in Iceland" then you win		gopher.black	70
ia prize!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI took a shortcut across the middle of a golf course at one point,		gopher.black	70
iand marveled once again at the well maintained and numerous trails		gopher.black	70
iand paths available in my area. Almost everything was well lit and		gopher.black	70
iclean. It was lovely! It took me over two hours to get home and		gopher.black	70
iI got a few hot-spots on my heels since I was walking in flimsy		gopher.black	70
islip-on shoes and not my boots. Still, no harm no foul.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, today I bought a car. :D It's a 2017 SsangYong Tivoli. It		gopher.black	70
iis white and in pretty good shape with only about 60,000km on it.		gopher.black	70
iI'm not sure you'll believe me now, but this was actually in the		gopher.black	70
iworks before Saturday's adventure. My wife and I were talking		gopher.black	70
iabout how nice it is here to be able to take the bus everywhere		gopher.black	70
iand how it was probably better for our health to do all the		gopher.black	70
iwalking. We also admitted that it's frustrating not to be able to		gopher.black	70
igo out into the countryside. We live only 25 minutes from		gopher.black	70
iþingvellir, after all, but we never go. We want to head up north		gopher.black	70
ithis summer and we were considering renting. But there's little		gopher.black	70
iannoyances too. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis summer there are a number of activities available to the kids		gopher.black	70
iin the area. One is a little zoo and horseback riding place where		gopher.black	70
ithe kids can learn to take care of the animals. It would be		gopher.black	70
iperfect for my boy. The farm is only 5 minutes away, but that's by		gopher.black	70
icar. It's directly on the other side of the mountain behind my		gopher.black	70
iapartment. To walk there would take an hour, each way. That's not		gopher.black	70
isomething we could sign him up for before. Now it's no problem.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPeople here also just assume you have a car or access to one. It		gopher.black	70
ican be tricky when activites happen at odd spots. Even travelling		gopher.black	70
ito IKEA from my place is a chore because it takes 4 transfers and		gopher.black	70
iover 2hrs to get there. Now with a car it's an 18 minute drive.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe don't intend to use it for everything. Certainly we want to		gopher.black	70
ihave it to go out into the country and see the sights. We also		gopher.black	70
iwill use it for things like IKEA trips. But we want to keep using		gopher.black	70
ithe bus to go downtown and walk to go shopping for groceries.		gopher.black	70
iI don't know how realistic that goal is, but we shall see.		gopher.black	70
