 Proxies
 January 05th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I forked Muffinista's gopher proxy [0] and made my own copy [1]
 that doesn't track anything, has no stats database locally, and
 doesn't load cross-domain scripts. It also defaults to the dark
 theme and also defaults to my gopher hole.
 
 http://tomasino.sdf.org [2] is the URL.
 
 You can navigate to lots of other gopher holes from it if you
 want, but it isn't perfect. When you send it to the SDF phlogs
 list, it downloads it as if it were a binary file. It does that
 occasionally on text files as well. Still, it looks pretty nice
 and it was the only source I found that seemed likely to run on
 SDF.
 
 Oh, and the source... it's really messy. This thing was originally
 going to run in a /gopher/ subdirectory, but everything in the
 source is hardcoded to domain root, including the whole rewrite
 engine for links and parsing. Blech! There's redundencies all over
 the place in the front-end code, including 3 seperate locations
 where javascript files can live. I might do a big refactor... but
 probably not. It solves a problem and that's good enough.
