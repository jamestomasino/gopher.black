iI forked Muffinista's gopher proxy [0] and made my own copy [1]
ithat doesn't track anything, has no stats database locally, and
idoesn't load cross-domain scripts. It also defaults to the dark
itheme and also defaults to my gopher hole.
i
ihttp://tomasino.sdf.org [2] is the URL.
i
iYou can navigate to lots of other gopher holes from it if you
iwant, but it isn't perfect. When you send it to the SDF phlogs
ilist, it downloads it as if it were a binary file. It does that
ioccasionally on text files as well. Still, it looks pretty nice
iand it was the only source I found that seemed likely to run on
iSDF.
i
iOh, and the source... it's really messy. This thing was originally
igoing to run in a /gopher/ subdirectory, but everything in the
isource is hardcoded to domain root, including the whole rewrite
iengine for links and parsing. Blech! There's redundencies all over
ithe place in the front-end code, including 3 seperate locations
iwhere javascript files can live. I might do a big refactor... but
iprobably not. It solves a problem and that's good enough.
