iI finally spent the 5 minutes necessary to download one of the few		gopher.black	70
iavailable Gemini clients. I went with AV-98 [0] from solderpunk.		gopher.black	70
iIt's interface is basically the same as VF-1, so it had that going		gopher.black	70
ifor it. Also, I didn't need to download a rust compiler. ;)		gopher.black	70

iWhile there's not a lot of content around gemini-space (more on		gopher.black	70
ithis in a second), it was still nice to have a way in to poke		gopher.black	70
iaround. I see some journal activity already taking shape, and		gopher.black	70
ithat's a great place to start.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'll be honest. At first I thought of Gemini as a neat but		gopher.black	70
iultimately useless side project of the already-tiny gopher		gopher.black	70
icommunity. The more I've seen it worked on and thought about it		gopher.black	70
ithe more I've come to consider it a "real thing" of some		gopher.black	70
iimportance. But lets come back to that idea in a minute.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFirst, lets talk about the naming of things.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Gemini" is the protocol. It appears to be capitalized in all		gopher.black	70
ioccurences within solderpunk's FAQ. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Gemini maps" are the temporary term for the document format of		gopher.black	70
ia Gemini server. It's coined by solderpunk here [1] and only named		gopher.black	70
ithat "until a better name comes along."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[1] Gemini maps	/~solderpunk/gemini/gemini-maps.txt	zaibatsu.circumlunar.space	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Geminiholes" - mentioned by solderpunk, but noone is using it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Gemini server/client" are the defacto name for individual tools		gopher.black	70
ithat power it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Gemini-verse / Gemini-sphere / Gemini ecosystem" - I haven't		gopher.black	70
inoted any special term for this akin to "the web" or		gopher.black	70
i"gopherspace". Is there something already in use?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"Journal" - weB LOG / goPHer LOG like structure. Is there		gopher.black	70
ia playful term for these yet?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat other terms are we missing?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOkay, enough of that. Time for THOUGHTS OF IMPORTANCE!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe built-in TLS by design of Gemini is great, and combined with		gopher.black	70
ithe natural ability to run it unpriviliged and require very little		gopher.black	70
ibandwidth I can see it serving a valuable purpose in safely		gopher.black	70
iproviding a platform for authors in situations where the web is		gopher.black	70
inot. Take Khazikstan, for instance, who is MITMing the entire		gopher.black	70
icountry. Gopher was always a nice idea to help in these		gopher.black	70
isituations, but the lack of reliable security on it meant major		gopher.black	70
iproblems for real applications. Gemini fixes that. What's more,		gopher.black	70
iGemini over tor adds in anonymity.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI have more thoughts on the tor thing, and around real-world		gopher.black	70
iapplications for a minimalist hyperlinkable publishing protocol		gopher.black	70
iwith built in anonymity and safety, but my internet connection is		gopher.black	70
idying and I have to finish this post while tethered to my phone.		gopher.black	70
iThank goodness for low bandwidth stuff like gopher and Gemini,		gopher.black	70
iright?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the meantime, what are your thoughts on using Gemini (one day)		gopher.black	70
iin a setting that's not just hobby play?		gopher.black	70
