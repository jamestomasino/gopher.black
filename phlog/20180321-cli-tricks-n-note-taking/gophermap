iCLI Tricks: n - note taking

iThis is the first in a series of phlog entries where I will share	
isome of my command line tricks, tips and scripts.

iNote-taking in the terminal is a big deal for me. Whether I'm in	
ia meeting or someone stops by for a quick interruption, I need to	
ibe able to jot down notes quickly and get at them again easily. To	
ihandle this I have built a helper function called "n". 	
i	
iNote: If you are familiar with my dotfiles [0] then you know	
iI keep all these scripts in a folder called ~/.functions and	
isource them as part of my .bash_profile.	
i	
i	
i### The Idea ###	
i	
iWhen I'm on the command line I enter the command "n" and it pops	
iup a list of all my notes using the FZF [1] fuzzy finder. These	
ihave a nice preview window to the side so I can quickly scan what	
iI'm looking for as I type in parts of the name. If I see what	
iI need in the preview I can either hit ESC to quit back to my	
ishell or ENTER to open up the note in my EDITOR.	
i	
iCreating a new note is easy:	
i	
i  $ n monkeys	
i	
i  > creates a new note in my NOTE_DIR called monkeys.md (I default	
i  > all my notes to markdown) and opens it in EDITOR	
i	
iWant to categorize them? Add a folder path:	
i	
i  $ n animals/monkeys	
i	
i  > creates a new note at $NOTE_DIR/animals/monkeys.md and opens	
i  > it in EDITOR	
i	
iYou can search foldernames as part of the fuzzy-finding.	
i	
iThe script also has bash-completion built-in. If you don't want to	
iuse FZF to browse for the file, just type part of the word and hit	
itab, like so:	
i	
i  $ n mo<TAB>	
i	
i  > n monkeys<ENTER>	
i	
i	
i### Requirements ###	
i	
iThis requires FZF [1], a fantastic utility for fuzzy-finding. I'm	
isure you could port it to another tool if you really wanted,	
ithough.	
i	
iThis also requires that you have an environment variable set	
icalled NOTE_DIR. For me that points to Dropbox where I have a	
inotes folder. This means all my notes are generated and stored	
ithere and are shared across systems. I can even get at them 	
iwith my phone.

i### The Source ###	
i	
i  #!/usr/bin/env bash	
i	
i  # Note taking function and command completion	
i  _n() {	
i    local lis cur	
i    lis=$(find "${NOTE_DIR}" -name "*.md" | \	
i      sed -e "s|${NOTE_DIR}/||" | \	
i      sed -e 's/\.md$//')	
i    cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}	
i    COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "$lis" -- "$cur") )	
i  }	
i  n() {	
i    : "${NOTE_DIR:?'NOTE_DIR ENV Var not set'}"	
i    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then	
i      local file	
i      file=$(find "${NOTE_DIR}" -name "*.md" | \	
i        sed -e "s|${NOTE_DIR}/||" | \	
i        sed -e 's/\.md$//' | \	
i        fzf \	
i          --multi \	
i          --select-1 \	
i          --exit-0 \	
i          --preview="cat ${NOTE_DIR}/{}.md" \	
i          --preview-window=right:70%:wrap)	
i      [[ -n $file ]] && \	
i        ${EDITOR:-vim} "${NOTE_DIR}/${file}.md"	
i    else	
i      case "$1" in	
i        "-d")	
i          rm "${NOTE_DIR}"/"$2".md	
i          ;;	
i        *)	
i          ${EDITOR:-vim} "${NOTE_DIR}"/"$*".md	
i          ;;	
i      esac	
i    fi	
i  }	
i  complete -F _n n
