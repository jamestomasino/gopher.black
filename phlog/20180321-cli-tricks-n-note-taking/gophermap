i		gopher.black	70
iThis is the first in a series of phlog entries where I will share		gopher.black	70
isome of my command line tricks, tips and scripts.		gopher.black	70

iNote-taking in the terminal is a big deal for me. Whether I'm in		gopher.black	70
ia meeting or someone stops by for a quick interruption, I need to		gopher.black	70
ibe able to jot down notes quickly and get at them again easily. To		gopher.black	70
ihandle this I have built a helper function called "n". 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNote: If you are familiar with my dotfiles [0] then you know		gopher.black	70
iI keep all these scripts in a folder called ~/.functions and		gopher.black	70
isource them as part of my .bash_profile.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i### The Idea ###		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen I'm on the command line I enter the command "n" and it pops		gopher.black	70
iup a list of all my notes using the FZF [1] fuzzy finder. These		gopher.black	70
ihave a nice preview window to the side so I can quickly scan what		gopher.black	70
iI'm looking for as I type in parts of the name. If I see what		gopher.black	70
iI need in the preview I can either hit ESC to quit back to my		gopher.black	70
ishell or ENTER to open up the note in my EDITOR.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCreating a new note is easy:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ n monkeys		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  > creates a new note in my NOTE_DIR called monkeys.md (I default		gopher.black	70
i  > all my notes to markdown) and opens it in EDITOR		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWant to categorize them? Add a folder path:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ n animals/monkeys		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  > creates a new note at $NOTE_DIR/animals/monkeys.md and opens		gopher.black	70
i  > it in EDITOR		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou can search foldernames as part of the fuzzy-finding.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe script also has bash-completion built-in. If you don't want to		gopher.black	70
iuse FZF to browse for the file, just type part of the word and hit		gopher.black	70
itab, like so:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ n mo<TAB>		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  > n monkeys<ENTER>		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i### Requirements ###		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis requires FZF [1], a fantastic utility for fuzzy-finding. I'm		gopher.black	70
isure you could port it to another tool if you really wanted,		gopher.black	70
ithough.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis also requires that you have an environment variable set		gopher.black	70
icalled NOTE_DIR. For me that points to Dropbox where I have a		gopher.black	70
inotes folder. This means all my notes are generated and stored		gopher.black	70
ithere and are shared across systems. I can even get at them 		gopher.black	70
iwith my phone.		gopher.black	70
