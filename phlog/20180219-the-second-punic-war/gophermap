 The Second Punic War
 February 19th, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I want a war epic made about the Second Punic War. It doesn't have
 to be about the entire war, I suppose, but it must capture Cannae,
 the rise of Scipio Africanus, and ultimately the salting of
 Carthage.
 
 Back in the day there were rumors of Vin Diesel making a Hannibal
 movie. I'd settle for that at this point. We have movies about all
 sorts of random crap!
 
 I let myself toy around with the idea of writing the script for
 about 2 whole minutes. That was nice, then I remembered I'm not
 a scriptwriter nor have I ever shown any talent or interest in
 that direction. Nope, I'll settle for someone elses art, thank
 you.
 
 You know how the universe sometimes seems to latch on to ideas
 you've had or talked about and suddenly it's all the rage and you
 got no credit for it, damnit? Maybe this can be one of those
 scenarios. Let's have a whole string of Roman films get made. We
 haven't had a Caesar movie in a while. How about Augustus? He's
 pretty wild. Or Nero... come on! Someone make a Nero movie. I'm
 sure there's enough British pride that we could sell a Cymbaline
 film, even. See that... I'll take fringe Romans.
 
 I would very much like something exciting to look forward to. 
 
 Well, crap. That sounds suuuuuper depressing. I didn't mean it
 that way, but then I read it and was like... Ugh.
 
 I've got exciting things to look forward to. At the very least,
 there's a 40lb lump in the next room who represents about
 a bajillion of those things. But still... I would love to put
 a shining star on top of this excitement tree. Toss a little
 tinsel around and stare up at the glory of a god-damned,
 monther-fucking, Ridley Scott directed, Hans Zimmer scored,
 action-packed adventure starring Vin Diesel and for some reason
 Michael Ironside in a romp across history in the testosterone
 dump, "AFRICANUS". (In theaters May 2020)
