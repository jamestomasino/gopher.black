iI just received the following email on an account I have which		gopher.black	70
imonitors conservative political action. I have similar feelers		gopher.black	70
iinto a few different areas so I can keep tabs on things. This one		gopher.black	70
istood out, especially in light of Trump's recent meeting with		gopher.black	70

iJames,		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHave you seen the Democrats lately?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThey're completely unhinged.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThey’re all over this country vowing to go further and further to		gopher.black	70
ithe Left. For weeks, they’ve been calling for harassment,		gopher.black	70
iintimidation, even the abolishment of ICE! Now, they’re promising		gopher.black	70
ito block President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee from ever		gopher.black	70
ireaching the bench.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThey want to ignore our laws, abuse our people, and obstruct our		gopher.black	70
iagenda by subjecting Judge Kavanaugh to a long, drawn out		gopher.black	70
iconfirmation process.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThey think their new tactics will chase all “deplorables” into		gopher.black	70
ihiding… but the silent majority is not backing down. We’re getting		gopher.black	70
itogether and we’re standing up. We’re knocking on doors and		gopher.black	70
ireaching voters for our National Week of Action to protect our		gopher.black	70
iPresident and make sure we win big in November.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd we need YOU to join us by going door to door to spread our		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iJames, the way I see it, if liberals want to come for our borders,		gopher.black	70
ifor our jobs, and OUR Supreme Court, and they’re willing to stop		gopher.black	70
iat nothing to make that happen.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe CAN win for the Silent Majority -- not by stooping down to the		gopher.black	70
ileft’s level -- but by volunteering in your neighborhood to turn		gopher.black	70
iout voters and spread our positive message of putting America		gopher.black	70

iWhat struck me most was the blatant use of the Left as an entity		gopher.black	70
iof otherness. Notice that it's the Left coming for OUR borders,		gopher.black	70
iSupreme Court, laws, and jobs. The Left wants to abuse OUR people.		gopher.black	70
iThis is an interesting and dangerous shift in rhetoric. It is		gopher.black	70
iessentially calling liberals anti-American and digging deeper the		gopher.black	70
idivide.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn a similar email last month the language used was based on		gopher.black	70
ifighting, shooting, and violence in general. "Strike back!" they		gopher.black	70
icheer.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is the stuff that later generations will point to with		gopher.black	70
idisgust and say, "how did they not see it coming?"		gopher.black	70
