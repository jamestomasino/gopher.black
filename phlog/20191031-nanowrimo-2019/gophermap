iThis year I'm going to participate in my own way in NaNoWriMo [0].		gopher.black	70
iI will not be attempting a whole novel or even their on-pace daily		gopher.black	70
iword count. It's not for me, though I wish I were that prolific.		gopher.black	70
iNo, instead I will be working on finishing some things. 		gopher.black	70

iFirst up: Emergence [1]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is a speculative fiction about the birth of an AI that		gopher.black	70
iI began a while back. I enjoyed some good progress on it and have		gopher.black	70
ibeen satisfied reading back and what came out (rare). Sadly, it		gopher.black	70
ifell off my priority list and has been sitting there begging for		gopher.black	70
isome love.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSince this is only a short story, it's not the same level of		gopher.black	70
iinvestment required as a whole novel. I've already got some good		gopher.black	70
idevelopment in place and notes on where I want it to go. Time to		gopher.black	70
ifinish it!		gopher.black	70

iNext: Trobairitz [2]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOver on Cosmic Voyage [3] I have a new "ship" in planning. This		gopher.black	70
ione is actually an interstellar group of women storytellers who		gopher.black	70
iare hired to share the stories from various cultures. The format		gopher.black	70
ifor it will be very different than we've seen so far on Cosmic in		gopher.black	70
ithat each post is a complete, self-contained story.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe first story that will be published is related to the Oleander		gopher.black	70
i[4] storyline, and shows a bit of the aftermath of that mission.		gopher.black	70
iI hope to have that first post done in November as well.		gopher.black	70

iFinally: Melchizedek [5]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you're following along in my main Cosmic Voyage storyline		gopher.black	70
iyou'll know that something pretty weird just went down. As excited		gopher.black	70
ias I am to explore that, there's a bit of a time delay involved.		gopher.black	70
iSo instead I need to switch my focus back to the other crew		gopher.black	70
isitting on the planets around Beta Hydri. It's always a joy to		gopher.black	70
iwrite Stephanie Janssen, so she'll probably get another log next,		gopher.black	70
ibut there's also an ignored plotline I need to chip away at on		gopher.black	70
iplanet 4 with Hildar Simms. The poor guy has spent 90 days in		gopher.black	70
iquarantine! Now that he's out, fun gets to begin.		gopher.black	70

1[5] Melchizedek	/ships/Melchizedek	cosmic.voyage	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI don't know that I'll get the to all this before the month ends,		gopher.black	70
ithough. We have our first visitors coming around the 20th. They'll		gopher.black	70
ibe staying with us until December, so I only get about 2/3rds of		gopher.black	70
ithe month to write. I hope it's enough to finish Emergence at the		gopher.black	70
ivery least. That's the minimum bar I want to set for myself.		gopher.black	70

iSo what about you? Are any of you planning on doing anything		gopher.black	70
ispecial for NaNoWriMo? Anyone actively following Melchizedek? Have		gopher.black	70
