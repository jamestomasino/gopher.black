iCLI Tricks: remind		gopher.black	70
iMarch 30th, 2021		gopher.black	70
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iremind - a sophisticated reminder service		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOne of the little cool CLI utilities I've been meaning to use is		gopher.black	70
iremind(1). It's a tool with a plain text, human readable calendar		gopher.black	70
iformat and some hefty power under the hood.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iLet's look at an example entry in a reminder file:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  REM July 6 +7 MSG tomasino's birthday %b%		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn looking at this line you can have a pretty good guess what it		gopher.black	70
imeans without any help at all. These insructions can become far		gopher.black	70
imore complex and esoteric as you start using the powerful		gopher.black	70
iprogramming features built into remind, but most of your entries		gopher.black	70
iare probably going to be as simple as this.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe main structure of a remind entry is:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  <trigger> <action> <body>		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the example above the trigger is:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  REM July 6 +7		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe action is:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  MSG		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd the body is:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  tomasino's birthday %b		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTechnically the "REM" at the start is optional, except in some		gopher.black	70
iweird cases where the line might begin with OMIT or RUN. It's		gopher.black	70
isafest just to keep it. Every line ends in % also.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWant the full list of options for a REM line? Sure...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iREM  [ONCE] [date_spec] [back] [delta] [repeat] [PRIORITY prio]		gopher.black	70
i[SKIP | BEFORE | AFTER] [OMIT omit_list]  [OMITFUNC  omit_func‐		gopher.black	70
ition] [AT time [tdelta] [trepeat]] [SCHED sched_function] [WARN		gopher.black	70
iwarn_function] [UNTIL expiry_date | THROUGH  last_date]  [SCAN‐		gopher.black	70
iFROM scan_date | FROM start_date] [DURATION duration] [TAG tag]		gopher.black	70
i<MSG | MSF | RUN | CAL | SATISFY | SPECIAL special | PS  |  PS‐		gopher.black	70
iFILE> body		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe trigger section is often a date and they follow some really		gopher.black	70
isimple and intuitive rules. If you list a full date including day,		gopher.black	70
imonth, and year, then it will trigger on that day. If you omit the		gopher.black	70
iyear then it will remind you on that calendar day every year. Omit		gopher.black	70
ithe month and it will remind you on that day every month. Simple,		gopher.black	70
iright?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat if you want the reminder to occur for several days leading up		gopher.black	70
ito the date? Just like in my example above, the +7 following		gopher.black	70
ia date will do that. In my case you get a full week's worth of		gopher.black	70
ireminders leading up to my birthday.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDate's can be more than just calendar days, though. For instance:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  REM SUN 1 --7 at 23:30 MSG Tilde Trivia with Tomasino %		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere I'm setting the date to the first Sunday of the month, minus		gopher.black	70
iseven days at 11:30pm. Well, if you move backwards one week from		gopher.black	70
ithe first sunday that gets you the last sunday of the month.		gopher.black	70
iA nice trick, right? Here we have a reminder for my radio show on		gopher.black	70
itilderadio.org. I should note that all times in remind(1) are in		gopher.black	70
iyour local timezone. If you are scripting something with external		gopher.black	70
idata and need to convert timezones there are functions built in		gopher.black	70
ifor that, though.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo far I've just shown off the MSG action, but there are several		gopher.black	70
iothers. Most notably there's the RUN action, which lets you		gopher.black	70
iexecute a program on your machine when the trigger occurs. Perhaps		gopher.black	70
iyou want to use that to output your todo list every Monday? Or		gopher.black	70
imaybe you have it automatically email you a system report on the		gopher.black	70
isecond Tuesday of the month. There's no limit to the options		gopher.black	70
iavailable.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo how do you use it?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWell, first you install remind(1). It's available in apt and most		gopher.black	70
iother package managers. There's a package for MacOS as well. It		gopher.black	70
iwill come with two executables: remind(1) and rem(1). The latter		gopher.black	70
iis a shortcut that will run remind(1) with the default remind file		gopher.black	70
i(normally ~/.reminders, but you can change it with an ENV var).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn my .profile I have the environment variable set to use a remind		gopher.black	70
ifile in XDG_CONFIG_HOME since I like a clean home dir.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  export DOTREMINDERS=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/remind/reminders		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThen inside that 'reminders' file I use a tiny script to		gopher.black	70
iautomatically include any files that match "*.rem" inside		gopher.black	70
ia special syncthing folder:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  SET HOME getenv("HOME")		gopher.black	70
i  include [HOME]/.syncthing/remind/		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis means I can organize my stuff into relevant files like		gopher.black	70
i"work.rem" and "birthdays.rem".		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's an incredible amount of depth you can get into with this		gopher.black	70
ithing. It can output to a terminal calendar or even an html		gopher.black	70
icalendar or just the plain reminders. It can generate a postscript		gopher.black	70
iprinter file and allows advanced commands for shading. It has		gopher.black	70
ia robust programming language built in as well that will make you		gopher.black	70
iscratch your head at first and then scoff at the childish		gopher.black	70
ilimitations of Outlook and Google Calendar. You can even build		gopher.black	70
iyour own custom functions in this thing.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe remind(1) man page is well written and packed full of		gopher.black	70
iexamples, but there's also some great tutorials online. Here's		gopher.black	70
ia few to start your explorations:		gopher.black	70
