iI reached my heaviest weight ever last month and it coincided with		gopher.black	70
isome health stuff that led me to a cardiologist. I'm going to		gopher.black	70
ia follow-up today, in fact. Good news is that I'm not in danger		gopher.black	70
iright now. Bad news is I have heart disease. I've got a family		gopher.black	70
ihistory of it, and I'm overweight with borderline pre-diabetes,		gopher.black	70
ihigh blood pressure, and low fitness level. All not great.		gopher.black	70

iI've got some things in the works, though. I bought a desk		gopher.black	70
itreadmill about a month back and that's been really good for		gopher.black	70
istepping me up in activity instead of sitting all day. My		gopher.black	70
icardiologist prescribed me regular swimming as well. And finally,		gopher.black	70
ithanks to some info from a friend, I started Wegovy.		gopher.black	70

iIt's one of those weight loss drugs, like Ozempic, but indicated		gopher.black	70
ispecifically for weight loss, not diabetes. I'm in my fourth week		gopher.black	70
inow and I've been shedding weight steadily. The first week was		gopher.black	70
iawkward with some GI issues. It was so easy for my habits to have		gopher.black	70
ime overeat and then wretch. I've adapted well and will step up in		gopher.black	70
idose size next week.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo far so good. I've a long way to go, but shedding the weight		gopher.black	70
iwill also help me as I increase my activity level again. Wish me		gopher.black	70
