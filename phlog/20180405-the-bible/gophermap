iYesterday I added a new section to my gopher hole [0]. It's the		gopher.black	70
iEnglish Standard Version of the Bible, used with permission. I've		gopher.black	70
iwritten a script to fetch books/chapters/verses on demand and used		gopher.black	70
iit to prepopulate a full view of the Bible, chapter by chapter.		gopher.black	70
iI'm pretty sure everything came in properly, but I'll be double		gopher.black	70
ichecking over the coming weeks.		gopher.black	70

iMy next step is to add some safeguards to the script and make it		gopher.black	70
iwork on demand as a cgi. There are limitations on how much can be		gopher.black	70
iqueried at once and such attached to the API, so I'll need to plan		gopher.black	70
iaccordingly. Stay tuned!		gopher.black	70

iIn the meantime, pop on over and give it a read. It's my favorite		gopher.black	70
itranslation: a literal one with modern grammar. I've opted to		gopher.black	70
isuppress chapter & verse markings as well as footnotes and just		gopher.black	70
ilet the text live on its own. I think it makes things much more		gopher.black	70
ireabable.		gopher.black	70
