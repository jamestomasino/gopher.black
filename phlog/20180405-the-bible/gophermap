iYesterday I added a new section to my gopher hole [0]. It's the	
iEnglish Standard Version of the Bible, used with permission. I've	
iwritten a script to fetch books/chapters/verses on demand and used	
iit to prepopulate a full view of the Bible, chapter by chapter.	
iI'm pretty sure everything came in properly, but I'll be double	
ichecking over the coming weeks.	
i	
iMy next step is to add some safeguards to the script and make it	
iwork on demand as a cgi. There are limitations on how much can be	
iqueried at once and such attached to the API, so I'll need to plan	
iaccordingly. Stay tuned!	
i	
iIn the meantime, pop on over and give it a read. It's my favorite	
itranslation: a literal one with modern grammar. I've opted to	
isuppress chapter & verse markings as well as footnotes and just	
ilet the text live on its own. I think it makes things much more	
ireabable.
