isolderpunk, visiblink and yargo have a great thread going on the		gopher.black	70
itopic of discrimination. Here's the most recent link to it, but		gopher.black	70
ithere's a history you can dig through [0].		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iIn visiblink's first post on the topic the discussion began with		gopher.black	70
ia comedian who repeatedly ridiculed a disabled child and a human		gopher.black	70
irights tribunal that then fined him for it. That's where I'd like		gopher.black	70
ito focus my very narrow band of thought on the topic.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhile the discussion that spawned has been interesting it has been		gopher.black	70
ifocused on what constitutes an appropriate topic of criticism. Is		gopher.black	70
iit based on whether that factor is in full control of the		gopher.black	70
iindividual, is it related to their culture or wealth, and does		gopher.black	70
ithat play a factor in what is appropriate. Great stuff... go read.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe part that stuck out to me was the concept of free speech and		gopher.black	70
iprotected speech, their terminology, and the psychology involved		gopher.black	70
iin each. Yargo, in a simplistic and unfair summary to him, stated		gopher.black	70
ithat he'd prefer to say whatever he likes without fear of legal		gopher.black	70
iconsequences. That's a great place to start.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere is some psychological system at play which places the idea		gopher.black	70
iof protection on the individuals who are criticized, or who are		gopher.black	70
ithe subject of hate speech. Media discussions surround the idea of		gopher.black	70
isensitivity and others refer to "snowflakes". Protection is		gopher.black	70
idemanded by the sensitive, or so it seems.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe know in reality that it is the speech which is the subject to		gopher.black	70
iprotection instead. It is not the targets of the speech, but the		gopher.black	70
ispeaker who needs focus here, right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe distinction is minor because the relationship between the		gopher.black	70
ispeaker and target haven't changed. But that's not the whole		gopher.black	70
istory, is it? If we use terms like "free speech" it hides part of		gopher.black	70
ithe story. When we say "protected speech" now we get at the crux.		gopher.black	70
iProtected by whom, and from whom?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere are other parties involved: the speaker, the subject, and		gopher.black	70
ithe protective entity and the persecutive entity. So when we look		gopher.black	70
iback at the discussion of protected speech now we can fit everyone		gopher.black	70
iinto context:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA speaker's (subject) speech toward someone (object) is		gopher.black	70
ipotentially protected (protector) from persecution (persecutor).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWho is the persecutor? In the case of the United States and the		gopher.black	70
i1st amendment from which most of this discussion flows for		gopher.black	70
iAmericans it is the US government itself.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWho is the protector? Well, again in this case, the US government.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of		gopher.black	70
i  religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging		gopher.black	70
i  the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the		gopher.black	70
i  people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for		gopher.black	70
i  a redress of grievances.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCongress is limited in their powers by the Constitution from		gopher.black	70
iabridging the freedom of speech.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDone, right? libertarians have at it. Except, no. Oliver Wendell		gopher.black	70
iHolmes comes knocking next...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the landmark case of Schenck v. United States, Holmes stated, 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a		gopher.black	70
i  man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOkay, so all speech is does not warrant protection under the first		gopher.black	70
iamendment. Where do we draw the line? Here we get into Public		gopher.black	70
iForum Regulation, Prior Restraint, Expressive Conduct, Defamation,		gopher.black	70
iand so on. Most appropriate to our discussion is the topic of		gopher.black	70
idefamation, and inciting, provocative, or offensive speech. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere we go to the courts to decide where the line should be. Did		gopher.black	70
ithat speech represent an individual freedom, or did it put at risk		gopher.black	70
ithe lives and liberty of others, such as by listing the home		gopher.black	70
iaddresses of families of abortion doctors? The line gets blurry,		gopher.black	70
iright? We're not talking about feelings being hurt anymore. Our 		gopher.black	70
iobjects of discussion potentially got much more serious.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBack to my focus: the protector and persecutor are the same		gopher.black	70
ientity, though perhaps different departments of it. That entity		gopher.black	70
iis given the power to determine what it protects from itself.		gopher.black	70
iThat's pretty weird when you word it like that, but so be it.		gopher.black	70
iWhat stands out though is that the justification for NOT		gopher.black	70
iprotecting speech is required based on the wording of the		gopher.black	70
iconstitution. The US government, at least, needs to justify a		gopher.black	70
idecision to step in and persecute a speaker (at least to itself).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhere was I going with this? I don't remember. I tried writing		gopher.black	70
ithis at work and got interrupted every five minutes. I think I was		gopher.black	70
igetting to something about the psychology of speech protection,		gopher.black	70
iasking an outside entity to come in and protect you from itself in		gopher.black	70
isome cases and not others. There was going to be a really cool		gopher.black	70
ireference to 80s sitcoms in there too.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMeh, now I'm hungry and totally forgot where I was going. So, um,		gopher.black	70
ithanks for sticking with me through the first half of a well		gopher.black	70
ithought-out argument. Marsha will validate your parking on your		gopher.black	70
iway out.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCheers!		gopher.black	70
