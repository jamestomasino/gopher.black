iI don't know what possessed me to try, but I've been sitting here		gopher.black	70
ifor the last five minutes trying not to see color. I stared at my		gopher.black	70
iGoodreads page (that's what was up at the time) and managed to get		gopher.black	70
ithe color to fade away in parts at a time but no luck on the full		gopher.black	70
icolor spectrum yet. The reds & greens were doable together, but		gopher.black	70
ithe blue is harder. If I focus on just not seeing blue then the		gopher.black	70
ired pops back in.		gopher.black	70

iPlease don't ask me to explain what I'm even doing to try this.		gopher.black	70
iThe best way I can explain would be to say it's like blurring your		gopher.black	70
ieyes, but they stay focused. Not helpful, right? It's also much		gopher.black	70
ieasier to do in the periphery than directly in the center of		gopher.black	70
ivision. I understand we have more cones in the center of vision		gopher.black	70
ithan rods, so that's probably why. If I'm doing something to be		gopher.black	70
iselective about that in good ol' brain meats, that would make		gopher.black	70
isense.		gopher.black	70
