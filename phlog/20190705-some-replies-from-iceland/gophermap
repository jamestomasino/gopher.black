iwe're settled in an airbnb for July getting everything in place.		gopher.black	70

iTonight I thought it would be fun to take stock of recent things		gopher.black	70
ihappening on gopher and send some feedback. So, here goes:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
imoji, over on circumlunar, has detailed their efforts to cut back		gopher.black	70
ion the caffeine [1]. It's a solid post and raises some good		gopher.black	70
ithoughts on what it means to be reliant on something like coffee.		gopher.black	70
iAddictions, even relatively benign ones, have some hold on you.		gopher.black	70
iI can totally respect the effort. More power too you.		gopher.black	70

ipkotrcka, whose name I have to be very careful typing out, wrote		gopher.black	70
ia neat phlog about cameras that put my head in weird places [2].		gopher.black	70
iMainly it made me sad that photography is pretty much dead.		gopher.black	70
iI mean, not really at all, but as a profession it's gone from this		gopher.black	70
ihighly technical artform with super expensive equipment, years of		gopher.black	70
itraining required and it's been overrun by quick snaps with your		gopher.black	70
iphone and bottled filters. There's little spots left for the art,		gopher.black	70
ilike wedding photos and... is that it? Really though it's a "dead"		gopher.black	70
itechnology in the same way gopher is.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's the part where my mind turned happy again. When we say		gopher.black	70
iit's dead that just means that capitalism stopped seeing monetary		gopher.black	70
ivalue. That's not the same thing at all. Why is there no money in		gopher.black	70
igopher? Well, not enough people to be worth the effort investing.		gopher.black	70
iPhotography? Same thing. Niche stuff sure, but other than than		gopher.black	70
ijust let it return to the afficianados. Let the pkotrckas of the		gopher.black	70
iworld have their fun, right? Keep on keeping on, pkotrcka.		gopher.black	70

iThe amazing, incredible visiblink did some hard work recently		gopher.black	70
icleaning up insulation and maybe asbestos [3]. Well done. That's		gopher.black	70
inot what I wanted to comment on at all, though. At the very end of		gopher.black	70
ithe phlog they mention that the gopher hole switched over to a pi		gopher.black	70
izero w, saving more power. I love this ultra-low power stuff.		gopher.black	70
iI have some basic notes on how I stripped my pi zero down to the		gopher.black	70

iubergeek got his son out kayaking and that's so awesome [4].		gopher.black	70
iI adore kayaking. It was really sad having to sell my kayak when		gopher.black	70
iwe moved. There's something really ... perfect about being out on		gopher.black	70
ithe water. I can close my eyes and feel myself relax just thinking		gopher.black	70

iI learned to kayak in Alaska in Resurrection Bay, near Seward. It		gopher.black	70
iwas cold and beautiful. I saw bears and salmon and eagles and was		gopher.black	70
iforever in love. I love lakes now. They're so smooth and you can		gopher.black	70
ijust pull yourself a bit with the paddles and drift away.		gopher.black	70

iAnyway, I can see why his son is connecting with it. I wish you		gopher.black	70

iFinally, there was a lot of talk this past week about Gemini's		gopher.black	70
ilink syntax [6,7,8]. Out goes the [|] and in comes the =>. I'm		gopher.black	70
iinto it, guys. It's cool as heck. Here's my 2-cents:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Spaces optional. You can split on whitespace easy enough with		gopher.black	70
i   regex alone and not care if it's one space, zero, or		gopher.black	70
i   a tab-space-tab-space salsa.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. Link first. We're talking about clients doing some magic in the		gopher.black	70
i   gemini world, but how much should we rely on the client's		gopher.black	70
i   display choices to fulfill that important note that a URL		gopher.black	70
i   should always be shown. If we have it at the end it could get		gopher.black	70
i   cropped off screen or hidden in a wrap or any number of things.		gopher.black	70
i   Link first is more likely to be seen, easier to parse across		gopher.black	70
i   languages, and MOST importantly, means that the label can be		gopher.black	70
i   optional. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   You see how I'm linking to things paragraph by paragraph in		gopher.black	70
i   this post? I have numbers referencing things with the square		gopher.black	70
i   bracket syntax because it's my convention, but the position of		gopher.black	70
i   the links in context to the copy says enough about what they		gopher.black	70
i   are. In many cases I just described the link in a paragraph and		gopher.black	70
i   the label on the link is redundant. If the label in gemini is		gopher.black	70
i   optional then you can just do something like:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   => gemini://cosmic.voyage		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   And let it live on its own.		gopher.black	70
