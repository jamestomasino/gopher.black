iI went through moku-pona[0] to clean up some shenanigans today.		gopher.black	70
iA lovely person reached out to me to be added to the list (hi		gopher.black	70
ibandali! [1]) and while I was in there I noticed my perl stuff was		gopher.black	70
iacting up. I guess the XML parsing was broken, so I did some CPAN		gopher.black	70
iwork and I think it's good again. I also noticed a handful of		gopher.black	70
iphlogs whose servers seem to be down. I trimmed them for now. If		gopher.black	70
ithey return and want re-added I can do that later.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iGrex.org in particular is a challenge. That server has long		gopher.black	70
iperiods of downtime, but usually comes back. I have a handful of		gopher.black	70
ipeople there in the list and I've left them for now. We'll see if		gopher.black	70
iit pops back online again at some point.		gopher.black	70

iI've been really sick for the past few weeks. My son got the flu		gopher.black	70
iabout a week before school let out. He was in bad shape and we		gopher.black	70
inearly went to the hospital. Thankfully his fever broke, but by		gopher.black	70
ithen my wife caught it, and then it was my turn. My flu, as per		gopher.black	70
iusual, developed into pneumonia and I'm still coming out of that		gopher.black	70
ifunk. I think this cough will be with me a while yet.		gopher.black	70

iThis weekend I'm going to try to record a new episode of Solarpunk		gopher.black	70
iPrompts [2], my podcast series about the movement. If you haven't		gopher.black	70
ichecked it out before please do so. It's for writers, but many		gopher.black	70
inon-writers enjoy it as well. The episodes are only about 10		gopher.black	70
iminutes long. I recommend listening to the intro episode first as		gopher.black	70
iit lays out what the podcast is about and its reason for being.		gopher.black	70
iAfter that you can listen to the episodes in any order.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh! The podcast is not only followable in podcast apps and RSS		gopher.black	70
ilike normal, but you can also follow it on Fedi! Check out:		gopher.black	70
