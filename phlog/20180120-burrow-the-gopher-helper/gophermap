iburrow - the gopher helper
iJanuary 20, 2018
i----------------------------------------

iI've done a good deal of work on my new gopher helper program
inamed 'burrow' [0]. For now it's taking my existing helper scripts
iand merging them into a single program that can take switches and
iarguments. I'm also moving the configuration out of environment
ivariables and into a proper config file.
i
iOnce I get back to where I started, I'm going to start broadening
ithe settings. I'm including template support for phlogs & recipes,
iand I'm going to modularize some things like my auto-space-indent
iof non-links in gophermaps.
i
iI'm also getting some practice with man writing. 
i
iIf you've got a gopher helper script or two lying around, have
ia look at this and maybe make a pull request to add your coolness.
