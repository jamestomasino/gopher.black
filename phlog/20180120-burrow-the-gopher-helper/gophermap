 burrow - the gopher helper
 January 20, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I've done a good deal of work on my new gopher helper program
 named 'burrow' [0]. For now it's taking my existing helper scripts
 and merging them into a single program that can take switches and
 arguments. I'm also moving the configuration out of environment
 variables and into a proper config file.
 
 Once I get back to where I started, I'm going to start broadening
 the settings. I'm including template support for phlogs & recipes,
 and I'm going to modularize some things like my auto-space-indent
 of non-links in gophermaps.
 
 I'm also getting some practice with man writing. 
 
 If you've got a gopher helper script or two lying around, have
 a look at this and maybe make a pull request to add your coolness.
