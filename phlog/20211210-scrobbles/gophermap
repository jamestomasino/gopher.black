iWhen Tidal first came out I jumped on it right away. I hadn't ever		gopher.black	70
iused a music subscription service before and I liked the hifi idea		gopher.black	70
iand also the higher artist payout rate than the competition.		gopher.black	70
iI stuck with it for a few months but ultimately felt it was too		gopher.black	70
ibuggy and dropped it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFast forward to this week. I decided I've been using Plex for free		gopher.black	70
ienough for several years that I should contribute financially.		gopher.black	70
iI have no real reason to get Plex Pass since it doesn't actually		gopher.black	70
ioffer any features I felt I was missing, but what the heck. So		gopher.black	70
iI picked up the life-time Plex Pass and while I'm doing it		gopher.black	70
iI notice they're promoting Tidal.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's not part of Plex Pass itself, but the Tidal subscription has		gopher.black	70
ia discount and integrates with Plex. That sounded pretty solid,		gopher.black	70
iand they had a 30 day trial. I figure, lets pick it up and try out		gopher.black	70
ithe holiday music. Maybe I'll discover new albums to join my		gopher.black	70
icollection!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt was an easy setup and it's running well. I remembered that		gopher.black	70
iI saw Robert Plant and Allison Krauss have another team-up album		gopher.black	70
ithat just came out (spotted the vinyl at the record shop on		gopher.black	70
iSaturday) so I checked it out (very good, like Raising Sand before		gopher.black	70
iit). I also tried out the new Tangerine Dream album (good for		gopher.black	70
ibackground, but boring for a focused listen). Overall I've been		gopher.black	70
ipoking around more in an exploratory nature. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA quick aside…		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI prefer to listen to music by album rather track. It's one of		gopher.black	70
ia number of reasons I've never had much interest in Spotify.		gopher.black	70
iI really like the arrangement of an album. How did the artists and		gopher.black	70
iproducers compile it together? Does it sweep through emotions or		gopher.black	70
ijostle them? How did it kick off and what track is batting		gopher.black	70
iclean-up? Is there a theme? There's just so much to it! I don't		gopher.black	70
ibuy songs; I buy albums.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut back to Tidal/Plex…		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm clicking around trying out all this new stuff and I have		gopher.black	70
ia moment of worry. You see, I don't really like subscription		gopher.black	70
iservices. If I can pay a one-time-fee I'm much more likely to		gopher.black	70
ipurchase, even if the cost seems cheaper to "rent" with a monthly		gopher.black	70
icharge. Tidal's monthly fee is going to annoy me sooner or later		gopher.black	70
iand I'm going to cancel it. When that happens there goes my		gopher.black	70
ihistory of my explorations. Boo.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut wait! Scrobbles!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's right, there's things like LastFM that let you scrobble		gopher.black	70
iyour plays to them so you can track them between services and		gopher.black	70
idevices and get insights into your listening habits. I love that!		gopher.black	70
iI have it configured for all my music players that support it on		gopher.black	70
ithis laptop, but I never thought about it in Plex, let alone Tidal		gopher.black	70
ivia Plex.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA bit of searching revealed that both Plex and Tidal have options		gopher.black	70
ito link to LastFM (yes, I know there are open source alternatives		gopher.black	70
ilike OpenFM and I have accounts there too, but most apps are		gopher.black	70
ihard-coded to support just LastFM, so I use it still). I added my		gopher.black	70
ilinks and now my glorious Christmas binge is scrobbling. But wait,		gopher.black	70
ithere's a problem! I configured scrobbling for Tidal via their web		gopher.black	70
imusic player. Plus I can play it through Plex as a player, so one		gopher.black	70
iof those two things should work, but they don't. I think it's		gopher.black	70
ibroken. *sniffle*		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo that's sad and I feel robbed of my scrobbles. It's funny, but		gopher.black	70
iit actually makes me want to use Tidal less! If it doesn't		gopher.black	70
iscrobble does it even count? Haha. No, not that. It's not that		gopher.black	70
iI need credit for listening. I want that data so I can reference		gopher.black	70
iit later or get recommendations based on it. That's valuable to		gopher.black	70
ime! Boo.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMaybe it'll get fixed soon. For now, back to Christmas.		gopher.black	70
