 solderpunk phlogged [0] about the Android gopher client, Pocket
 Gopher, available on F-Droid. I downloaded it when I heard about
 it on Mastodon a few months back and my experiences are similar to
 those he brings up. Many complaints I have apply to all gopher
 clients and proxies I've used.
 
 Complains about gopher on a phone:
 
   - Colors are often black text on white bg. That sucks. (not
     a problem in Pocket Gopher)
   - Fonts are often bad, not changable. (Pocket Gopher is pretty,
     but not customizable)
   - Text width is a challenge in portrait. Most clients give no
     option to toggle between auto-wrapping and preformatted, let
     alone do an interpretive reflow like solderpunk suggests.
   - Lack of bookmarking / start-page configuration (nicely solved
     in Pocket Gopher)
 
 Pocket Gopher specific complaints:
 
   - If I tap the screen and miss a link the font size changes and
     shrinks slightly. I can repeat this a few times before it
     settles. Sometimes the screen jumps as a result and I end up
     tapping the wrong link.
 
 It's nice having options in clients but nothing in the Android
 market has wow'd me yet. There's some active development on the
 iOS side, so maybe we'll see some of those new clients port over.
