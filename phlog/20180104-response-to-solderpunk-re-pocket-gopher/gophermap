isolderpunk phlogged [0] about the Android gopher client, Pocket
iGopher, available on F-Droid. I downloaded it when I heard about
iit on Mastodon a few months back and my experiences are similar to
ithose he brings up. Many complaints I have apply to all gopher
iclients and proxies I've used.
i
iComplains about gopher on a phone:
i
i  - Colors are often black text on white bg. That sucks. (not
i    a problem in Pocket Gopher)
i  - Fonts are often bad, not changable. (Pocket Gopher is pretty,
i    but not customizable)
i  - Text width is a challenge in portrait. Most clients give no
i    option to toggle between auto-wrapping and preformatted, let
i    alone do an interpretive reflow like solderpunk suggests.
i  - Lack of bookmarking / start-page configuration (nicely solved
i    in Pocket Gopher)
i
iPocket Gopher specific complaints:
i
i  - If I tap the screen and miss a link the font size changes and
i    shrinks slightly. I can repeat this a few times before it
i    settles. Sometimes the screen jumps as a result and I end up
i    tapping the wrong link.
i
iIt's nice having options in clients but nothing in the Android
imarket has wow'd me yet. There's some active development on the
iiOS side, so maybe we'll see some of those new clients port over.
