iI was leaning against the counter in my kitchen while typing in		gopher.black	70
iIRC and then started a coughingn fit. Why am I coughing,		gopher.black	70
iI wondered as I rubbed at the bruise forming on my solar plexus.		gopher.black	70
iDerp.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm now sitting comfortably in the stool that was right beside me.		gopher.black	70
iI am very smart. :/		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnywho, I'm on break for Christmas this week and I hope to get		gopher.black	70
ia few fun side-things accomplished. For one, I'd like to write at		gopher.black	70
ileast one substantial update for each of my ships in cosmic [0].		gopher.black	70
iMy original ship, Melchizedek, is in trouble with their botany		gopher.black	70
isystems, while Starbloom may be going to war. My two newest ships		gopher.black	70
iare Oleander, which is the story of a suicide mission sending		gopher.black	70
itheir final messages before activation, and Melvin P Feltersnatch,		gopher.black	70
ia silly story with bad physics and quite a bit of nonsense.		gopher.black	70

1[0] Cosmic Voyage	/	cosmic.voyage	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI also dusted off a project idea I had called Ways. It's intended		gopher.black	70
ito be an open-source text-adventure engine and expandable world.		gopher.black	70
iRight now it's very much in "dream up the stuff" phase. I'm not		gopher.black	70
ibothering to even choose a programming language yet. I want to get		gopher.black	70
iall the concepts down in a README so I can go at it later for		gopher.black	70
iexecution. This week should give me a decent start on that.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn other news, Christmas is nearly upon us! I've been teaching my		gopher.black	70
ison about the Icelandic Yule Lads and Yule Cat and he's loving it.		gopher.black	70
iWe've been leaving his shoe in the window each night and reading		gopher.black	70
iup on each of the lads. It's so cute.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOMG, I haven't written since we sold the house! Um, yeah. We sold		gopher.black	70
iour house on the 10th of December. I'm renting a 2br apartment		gopher.black	70
iabout a mile away from the house until the end of June when we		gopher.black	70
iintend to make the move to Iceland. I've given myself a break from		gopher.black	70
iany planning on that front until the new year, too. Self care?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe had a 5 bedroom house with a massive basement and detached		gopher.black	70
igarage. Needless to say, we downsized quite a bit and are		gopher.black	70
icontinuing to do so. My wife found an awesome charity that takes		gopher.black	70
ihome goods and furniture for kids aging out of the foster system		gopher.black	70
iand moving out on their own. Most of the house goods went to them.		gopher.black	70
iMy son gave up 2/3rds of his toys to Goodwill. I downsized my		gopher.black	70
icomputers to a single laptop (which I'm replacing next Friday with		gopher.black	70
ia new one from System 76). We have a storage unit that is 10x20		gopher.black	70
iand needs to get reduced down to 5x10 before June. The stuff		gopher.black	70
iremaining will go into long-term storage in Charlotte near my		gopher.black	70
iwife's family. The stuff in the apartment will get packed up and		gopher.black	70
ishipped to Iceland. Somehow we'll make it all work.		gopher.black	70

iThere's been so many awesome discussions kicking around in		gopher.black	70
igopherspace that I haven't been engaging with. Ugh, now I want to		gopher.black	70
igo back and write you all individual responses here. Instead, just		gopher.black	70
iknow that I'm reading everything in great detail, from the stuff		gopher.black	70
ion the growing Zaibatsu adventure to the music generation scripts		gopher.black	70
ito the OTHER burrow to home-grown RPGs. You are all amazing people		gopher.black	70
iwho keep me entertained and inspired. Especially you, Melton. Your		gopher.black	70
ilife is incredible. Never stop writing.		gopher.black	70
