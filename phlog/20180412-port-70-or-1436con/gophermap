iHere's the thing. I want to do it.	
i	
iObviously it's not going to be in-person, but a virtual conference	
iis totally doable. Here's what I'm thinking:	
i	
i  - A 24 hour conference	
i  - Everyone can submit a proposal for a session they want to run	
i    with the following info:	
i	
i    - Who you are (handle)	
i    - Title / Subject of talk	
i    - Duration	
i    - Preferred time-slot in UTC	
i    - Medium of talk (video stream, audio stream, etc)	
i    - Where will you be watching for feedback/discussion (IRC,	
i      Social Media, raw TCP packets?)	
i	
i    We will need a place where these can be submitted and stored.	
i    It would be great if the submissions could be done in Gopher	
i    itself (anyone want to volunteer to write a cgi for	
i    submissions?).	
i  	
i  - After X number of days/weeks, we close submissions and print	
i    up a schedule for everyone to review	
i  - On the day of the event, it's up to the speakers to get	
i    themselves online in their medium. (Maybe we can get a 24hr	
i    anonradio takeover?)	
i  - Folks can tune in and join the relevant chats	
i  - Archive the shit out of all of it and host it EVERYWHERE	
i	
iI also think we should do one or two "special" sessions and close	
ioff the time blocks so they're not up against anyone else.	
iRound-table or panel discussions would be cool for this. I welcome	
iideas.	
i	
iFinally, I think a hackathon would be cool to toss in the mix. It	
icould be done the day of, or the day before and results shared out	
ion the day. I'm not sure what we could gather in prizes, but for	
iour retro-con I bet we could get a couple minor sponsors willing	
ito toss in some swag. I'd be amazed if smj didn't jump at the	
iopportunity to offload some old SDF stickers. ;)	
i	
iLike the panel discussion, the focus of the hackathon would be	
isomething great to debate. My first suggestion: "Gopher meets	
iDocker". What sorts of amazingly cool configurations could we bust	
iout for the community in easy-to-deploy ways? TLS? TOR? Whatever	
iyou can dream up. We could vote on the winners on GopherPoll or	
isomething.	
i	
iSpeaking of GopherPoll (thanks tfurrows for pointing it out),	
iI'd like to offer one up right away and get your feedback:
