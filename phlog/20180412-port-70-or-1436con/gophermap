i		gopher.black	70
iHere's the thing. I want to do it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iObviously it's not going to be in-person, but a virtual conference		gopher.black	70
iis totally doable. Here's what I'm thinking:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - A 24 hour conference		gopher.black	70
i  - Everyone can submit a proposal for a session they want to run		gopher.black	70
i    with the following info:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    - Who you are (handle)		gopher.black	70
i    - Title / Subject of talk		gopher.black	70
i    - Duration		gopher.black	70
i    - Preferred time-slot in UTC		gopher.black	70
i    - Medium of talk (video stream, audio stream, etc)		gopher.black	70
i    - Where will you be watching for feedback/discussion (IRC,		gopher.black	70
i      Social Media, raw TCP packets?)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    We will need a place where these can be submitted and stored.		gopher.black	70
i    It would be great if the submissions could be done in Gopher		gopher.black	70
i    itself (anyone want to volunteer to write a cgi for		gopher.black	70
i    submissions?).		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i  - After X number of days/weeks, we close submissions and print		gopher.black	70
i    up a schedule for everyone to review		gopher.black	70
i  - On the day of the event, it's up to the speakers to get		gopher.black	70
i    themselves online in their medium. (Maybe we can get a 24hr		gopher.black	70
i    anonradio takeover?)		gopher.black	70
i  - Folks can tune in and join the relevant chats		gopher.black	70
i  - Archive the shit out of all of it and host it EVERYWHERE		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI also think we should do one or two "special" sessions and close		gopher.black	70
ioff the time blocks so they're not up against anyone else.		gopher.black	70
iRound-table or panel discussions would be cool for this. I welcome		gopher.black	70
iideas.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFinally, I think a hackathon would be cool to toss in the mix. It		gopher.black	70
icould be done the day of, or the day before and results shared out		gopher.black	70
ion the day. I'm not sure what we could gather in prizes, but for		gopher.black	70
iour retro-con I bet we could get a couple minor sponsors willing		gopher.black	70
ito toss in some swag. I'd be amazed if smj didn't jump at the		gopher.black	70
iopportunity to offload some old SDF stickers. ;)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iLike the panel discussion, the focus of the hackathon would be		gopher.black	70
isomething great to debate. My first suggestion: "Gopher meets		gopher.black	70
iDocker". What sorts of amazingly cool configurations could we bust		gopher.black	70
iout for the community in easy-to-deploy ways? TLS? TOR? Whatever		gopher.black	70
iyou can dream up. We could vote on the winners on GopherPoll or		gopher.black	70
isomething.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSpeaking of GopherPoll (thanks tfurrows for pointing it out),		gopher.black	70
iI'd like to offer one up right away and get your feedback:		gopher.black	70
