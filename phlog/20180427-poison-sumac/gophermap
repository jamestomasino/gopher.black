iWe had a storm here a few weeks back that did a bunch of damage to		gopher.black	70
ithe trees in my yard. One of these trees in the backyard split		gopher.black	70
iinto three pieces straight down the middle!		gopher.black	70

iOn Saturday I took my hatchet and a chain saw (literally saw-teeth		gopher.black	70
ion a chain that you drag back and forth by hand) and I set to work		gopher.black	70
iclearing things. In the process of chopping and sawing I failed to		gopher.black	70
inotice that the sad tri-split tree was also surrounded by an		gopher.black	70
iovergrown bush of poison sumac. (If you're not familiar with this		gopher.black	70
iparticular breed of awfulness, it's just like poison ivy or poison		gopher.black	70
ioak, but harder to identify.)		gopher.black	70

iI was mostly prepared for the work, wearing long pants and sturdy		gopher.black	70
igloves. I didn't have on a long sleeve shirt, though (it was		gopher.black	70
ihot!). So, now I'm super itchy and covered in a blistery rash.		gopher.black	70
iCalamine lotion helps a bit, but I'm ready for this ordeal to be		gopher.black	70
iover.		gopher.black	70

iI've gotten hit by sumac twice before, and thankfully this time is		gopher.black	70
imuch less severe. My first exposure was on a canoeing trip where		gopher.black	70
iI failed to notice that the creek I was in was surrounded on both		gopher.black	70
isides by sumac. I was covered in a rash from the waist up after		gopher.black	70
ithat trip.		gopher.black	70

iThe second time was the worst. I was in Boy Scouts on a camping		gopher.black	70
itrip and one of the new scouts tossed in a bunch of green branches		gopher.black	70
iinto the fire. It started smoking and flew into my face before		gopher.black	70
iI noticed what was going on. I was just about to explain why we		gopher.black	70
idon't burn green wood when I saw what it was. Too late. I was		gopher.black	70
ihospitalized that time, as I got the sumac in my eyes and lungs.		gopher.black	70
iNo good at all.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI hope this clears up soon. I'm so damned itchy!		gopher.black	70
