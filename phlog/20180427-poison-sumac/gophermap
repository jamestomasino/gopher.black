iPoison Sumac

iWe had a storm here a few weeks back that did a bunch of damage to	
ithe trees in my yard. One of these trees in the backyard split	
iinto three pieces straight down the middle!	
i	
iOn Saturday I took my hatchet and a chain saw (literally saw-teeth	
ion a chain that you drag back and forth by hand) and I set to work	
iclearing things. In the process of chopping and sawing I failed to	
inotice that the sad tri-split tree was also surrounded by an	
iovergrown bush of poison sumac. (If you're not familiar with this	
iparticular breed of awfulness, it's just like poison ivy or poison	
ioak, but harder to identify.)	
i	
iI was mostly prepared for the work, wearing long pants and sturdy	
igloves. I didn't have on a long sleeve shirt, though (it was	
ihot!). So, now I'm super itchy and covered in a blistery rash.	
iCalamine lotion helps a bit, but I'm ready for this ordeal to be	
iover.	
i	
iI've gotten hit by sumac twice before, and thankfully this time is	
imuch less severe. My first exposure was on a canoeing trip where	
iI failed to notice that the creek I was in was surrounded on both	
isides by sumac. I was covered in a rash from the waist up after	
ithat trip.	
i	
iThe second time was the worst. I was in Boy Scouts on a camping	
itrip and one of the new scouts tossed in a bunch of green branches	
iinto the fire. It started smoking and flew into my face before	
iI noticed what was going on. I was just about to explain why we	
idon't burn green wood when I saw what it was. Too late. I was	
ihospitalized that time, as I got the sumac in my eyes and lungs.	
iNo good at all.	
i	
iI hope this clears up soon. I'm so damned itchy!
