i		gopher.black	70
iI'm going to make a zine.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSDF said they were going to do one last year and I volunteered to		gopher.black	70
icontribute, but it seems like nothing came of it. So, what the		gopher.black	70
ihell, lets get our zine on.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAre you unfamiliar with zines? A zine is a small-circulation		gopher.black	70
iself-published work of original or appropriated texts and images,		gopher.black	70
iusually reproduced via photocopier. (Thanks Gopherpedia) [0] They		gopher.black	70
iwere really big in the early 90s. They also went digital and there		gopher.black	70
iwas a whole Usenet alt for them at one point. Here, check out		gopher.black	70
ia famous hacker one. [1]		gopher.black	70

iI've got some ideas around this zine, so let me blast you in the		gopher.black	70
iface with some awesome. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Issues will be published in entirely arbitrary times. I'm not		gopher.black	70
i   going to make this a regular thing, and I'm not promising		gopher.black	70
i   you'll see an issue number 3.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. The format is mutable. You may get a PDF for one, a weird		gopher.black	70
i   side-scrolling website for another, or a weird port listener		gopher.black	70
i   interactive experience [2] that fails to meet any common		gopher.black	70
i   definition.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
i3. There will be a theme to each issue. The glue that binds it all		gopher.black	70
i   together will be the theme (and possibly horse parts). Expect		gopher.black	70
i   wild takes on the theme, possible nonsense.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i4. It must be community driven.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Here's where you come in! See, I want to put it all together		gopher.black	70
i   and have fun and stuff, but I don't want to create 100% of the		gopher.black	70
i   weird crap on my own. So, I figure I'll announce the theme and		gopher.black	70
i   give you guys a way to contact me if you're interested in		gopher.black	70
i   contributing.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   In fact, lets just cut to that part right now.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe yet-to-be-named zine will have its inaugural issue soon. If		gopher.black	70
iyou'd like to be a contributor, it's easy! Here's what you do:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Contact me via email. You can find my addresses in the About		gopher.black	70
i  page on this gopher hole [3].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
1[3] About me!	/about
i		gopher.black	70
i- Tell me that you want to contribute something. You don't need to		gopher.black	70
i  tell me what it is you want to contribute. I don't care what		gopher.black	70
i  format it is in, whether it's words or art or music or a dance.		gopher.black	70
i  I don't care if you're cutting out cardboard creatures and		gopher.black	70
i  snaping pics of them doing naughty shit. If it fits the theme,		gopher.black	70
i  go to town.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Meet the deadline. I'll set a date when I need stuff by. Gimme		gopher.black	70
i  access to whatever you've done by then or I'll assume you flaked		gopher.black	70
i  out again, Jeff.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Let me know if you want to be identified, or how you want to be		gopher.black	70
i  identified for your work.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Bask in the glory. Seriously. This is a requirement. No sitting		gopher.black	70
i  back and gracefully accepting praise is allowed. You MUST bask		gopher.black	70
i  in the glory. I'll be watching.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, what's the theme of this first issue, already? What format		gopher.black	70
iwill it take? When's the deadline? What other questions can I ask		gopher.black	70
ias I type out this phlog because I'm stalling while I try to make		gopher.black	70
ia decision on the fly? Who else expected that I knew these answers		gopher.black	70
ibefore I started this post? Did anyone really expect me to have		gopher.black	70
ia well thought out plan here, or is it obvious this is coming out		gopher.black	70
iof my butt right now? Is my internal monologue-turned-gopher-phlog		gopher.black	70
imaking you smile at least?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe theme is...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i                            HAMMER		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYep, Hammer. What sort of Hammer am I talking about? Is it the		gopher.black	70
iformer M.C.? Or maybe the tool? Or the sport? Or maybe the		gopher.black	70
iweapon!? Or maybe it's the part of a gun you cock (teehee). Or the		gopher.black	70
itiny bones in your ear. Or maybe it's something else entirely. I'm		gopher.black	70
inot saying! You figure it out, suckas.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs for the format of the first zine... that depends on what sort		gopher.black	70
iof shit I get back. I'm not telling you, so you can go off the		gopher.black	70
ideep end if you want. I'll just have to deal with whatever comes		gopher.black	70
iin. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAgain, absolutely ANYTHING is okay to submit if it fits the theme		gopher.black	70
iin any way. If you have a stirring and deviant fursona fanfic of		gopher.black	70
iLogan's Run that you've been dying to share, then find a way to		gopher.black	70
imake it about HAMMER and you're in. If you want to draw me		gopher.black	70
ia picture of a HAMMER, cool. Maybe you have a really good		gopher.black	70
itechnique for keying in MORSE? That arm thingy is kinda like		gopher.black	70
ia HAMMER, right? Be creative, be technical, be personal, be		gopher.black	70
iawesome.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAlso, I'm not censoring anything here. If you have stuff that's		gopher.black	70
iwildly inappropriate, bring. it. on.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, when's the due date? Hmmmmm....		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i                          Tomorrow!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i                       no. not really.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i      That sounded fun in my head, but it would be idiotic.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i                       Let's go with...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i                         August 31st.		gopher.black	70
i                        		gopher.black	70
iGot it? That's just over a month to put together something,		gopher.black	70
ianything, that can be shoved into a weird-ass package and put out		gopher.black	70
iinto the intertubes. Once I get all the shizzle, I'll make		gopher.black	70
isomething fo-rizzle. Capice?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow, my minions, GO FORTH AND CREATE! (and also email me if you're		gopher.black	70
idoing something so I know that this is gonna work).		gopher.black	70
