iYesterday cat posted on Mastodon that someone should jump on		gopher.black	70
iopenVOIP and monologue. That sounded like a great idea and		gopher.black	70
iI wasn't busy, so I decided I'd go for it. My first thought was		gopher.black	70
ithat I'd read some Virgil or maybe Bronte. I walked into my dining		gopher.black	70
iroom which has the main collection of our books and looked over my		gopher.black	70
ishelves for something good. Boy Scout Handbook... Nimzowitsch...		gopher.black	70
iHarry Potter in Latin... ahh, here we are:		gopher.black	70

iZORK #4: Conquest at Quendor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIs there a more perfect book for the SDF crew than a choose your		gopher.black	70
iown adventure ZORK? I snapped a quick picture of the cover and		gopher.black	70
iposted it to mastodon, then walked upstairs to my office. A note		gopher.black	70
ion IRC or two and I was dialing in to the openVOIP line. At first		gopher.black	70
ithere was some sort of text adventure being played out with		gopher.black	70
iDaniel's robot voice narrating it. That wrapped up and I got		gopher.black	70
istarted.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt was awkward, silly, and entirely too much fun. Instead of		gopher.black	70
ipicking the choices in the book myself I tossed them out to the		gopher.black	70
icrowd to chime in. The engagement from people in com, mastodon,		gopher.black	70
iand IRC made the experience for me. I was riding a high afterwards		gopher.black	70
iand talked myself into doing it again. This time, though, I'll do		gopher.black	70
iit right.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe anonradio mailing list folks agreed that the show was worthy		gopher.black	70
iof a time slot, so now on Thursday nights/Friday mornings at 0100		gopher.black	70
iUTC, or 9PM EST, I'll be continuing our adventures. This first		gopher.black	70
i"real" show I'll finish up the ZORK story so I don't leave		gopher.black	70
ieveryone hanging, and then we'll start a new adventure. I don't		gopher.black	70
iknow that I'll make a point of finishing the adventures or not. If		gopher.black	70
itime runs out I may just start a new one the next week instead of		gopher.black	70
itrying to pick up again. On the one hand, it's nice to have some		gopher.black	70
icompletion, but these are books designed to be tried again and		gopher.black	70
iagain. Also, the authors aren't getting paid for this beyond me		gopher.black	70
ibuying a book or two, so I like the idea of enticing people with		gopher.black	70
ithe show so that they might go out and pick up a copy if they		gopher.black	70
ienjoy it. That makes the whole thing seem much more legit, right?		gopher.black	70
