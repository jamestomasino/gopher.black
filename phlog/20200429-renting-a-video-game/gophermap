iNostalgia struck. I'm back in a childhood home giddy with		gopher.black	70
iexcitement over the Nintendo Entertainment System which stealthily		gopher.black	70
iarrived as the last present opened at Christmas. My parents sprung		gopher.black	70
ifor the unit that came with two game cartridges, not just one:		gopher.black	70
iSuper Mario Bros. & Duck Hunt on one cartridge, and Teenage Mutant		gopher.black	70
iNinja Turtles on the other. It's visceral. I can smell the box.		gopher.black	70
iFeel the plastic.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iGames then were expensive. I suppose they're still expensive, but		gopher.black	70
iI don't buy so many. A game like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cost		gopher.black	70
iabout $50 in the late 80s. With some napkin math, that's around		gopher.black	70
i$80-85 today. Pricey, as I said. We didn't get new ones often.		gopher.black	70
iYears--and many garage sales--later, I have 57 games in my		gopher.black	70
icollection. As a kid, I had around 20 at the most.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDon't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting games were worth this much		gopher.black	70
iback then, but it's what we had. There's games I've got that		gopher.black	70
iaren't worth a dime. The Adventures of Dino Rikki comes to mind.		gopher.black	70
iWhat a piece of trash! Still, it cost a fortune and I had no way		gopher.black	70
iof knowing if it was going to be terrible. Maybe a friend had it		gopher.black	70
iand could warn me. Maybe it would get a mention in Nintendo Power		gopher.black	70
imagazine. Otherwise, you're shopping by box art.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat was until the video rental stores got in on the action. It		gopher.black	70
iwas a brilliant outgrowth from home video. For a dollar or two you		gopher.black	70
icould take home a game for a few days. Sure, you weren't likely to		gopher.black	70
imaster it or beat it, and your save game was gone when it was		gopher.black	70
ireturned. Even so, what an incredible tool to avoid wasting big		gopher.black	70
imoney on flops.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI vividly remember renting Life Force [0] from the Video Stop.		gopher.black	70
iWhat a brilliant game that was. I loved the gameplay and the		gopher.black	70
isprites. There was one that looked like an uncooked chicken		gopher.black	70
icrawling on the ground. Awesome. I believe that eventually many of		gopher.black	70
ithose sprites, sound effects, and much of the gameplay code would		gopher.black	70
iget revisited in The Guardian Legend, my favorite NES game of all		gopher.black	70
itime.		gopher.black	70

iThat rental was awesome and eventually I'd get my own copy of the		gopher.black	70
igame. Others... well [1], I own some of those anyway.		gopher.black	70

iI don't really have a big reason for sharing this. It just came to		gopher.black	70
imy mind and was worth a smile. Hope it gave you one too.		gopher.black	70
