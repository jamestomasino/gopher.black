iWhat a great day for net news! Not only is cosmic.voyage,		gopher.black	70
itilde.team, and news.tildeverse.org (yourtilde.com) peering, but		gopher.black	70
inow tilde.black has been added as well. Tilde Black is my tilde		gopher.black	70
idedicated to discussions, research and expirementation on the		gopher.black	70
itopics of privacy, anonymity and and security. It's an openbsd		gopher.black	70
imachine, which brought with it a new set of challenges. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's a quick note on special sauce needed for openbsd:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- clone from source as there's no package		gopher.black	70
i- make sure to install a bunch of perl dependencies listed in the		gopher.black	70
i  INSTALL file. It makes heavy use of these during make		gopher.black	70
i- use gmake not make if you can		gopher.black	70
i- configure --without-openssl is a must. The specific requirements		gopher.black	70
i  for TLS don't play nice with libssl		gopher.black	70
i- once you make install the paths will not be /etc/news and		gopher.black	70
i  /var/lib/news but rather /usr/local/news/etc and		gopher.black	70
i  /usr/local/news/db respectively.		gopher.black	70
i- innd won't start automatically. You'll need to change to the		gopher.black	70
i  "news" user and run /usr/local/news/bin/rc.news start.		gopher.black	70
i  I installed sudo to do it since my news user is non-login.		gopher.black	70
i- /usr/local/news/bin is also the path to ctlinnd, which you need		gopher.black	70
i  to install groups and restart the innd process.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOtherwise the setup was pretty much the same as in my previous		gopher.black	70
ipost. Very cool.		gopher.black	70
