iRichard Stallman found himself in nerd-headlines today when an		gopher.black	70
iarticle circulated on Hacker News and Lobste.rs titled "Who		gopher.black	70
iControls glibc?" [0]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[0] Who Controls glibc?	URL:http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/753646/a6ebb50040c5862c/
i		gopher.black	70
iIn short, some of the maintainers of glibc attempted to remove		gopher.black	70
ia comment that Stallman had added to the source in the 90s. This		gopher.black	70
icomment was a reference to censorship in the form of hyperbole		gopher.black	70
iabout the function being named "abort". Sensationalized headlines		gopher.black	70
irefer to it as a bad abortion joke, but that is clearly		gopher.black	70
ia mischaracterization. Regardless of the content of the comment		gopher.black	70
iitself, it was Stallman's response that created a minor		gopher.black	70
icontroversy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe maintainers claim they had consensus in the community that the		gopher.black	70
icomment (they refer to it as a joke) was unnecessary in the code		gopher.black	70
iand should be removed. Stallman stated firmly that it will not be		gopher.black	70
iremoved. This created an abrupt conflict in the eyes of the		gopher.black	70
imaintainers who believed that the project is community controlled.		gopher.black	70
iStallman stated unequivocally that he is the de facto decision		gopher.black	70
imaker of the GNU Project, which trumps community.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow I've previously mentioned that I'm a monarchist [1], and not		gopher.black	70
iin favor of democracy as a general rule. You will therefore		gopher.black	70
iunderstand why I inherently support Stallman's position. But lets		gopher.black	70
idive a bit deeper anyway.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iThe glibc maintainers are upset that Stallman, who in their eyes		gopher.black	70
iis not contributing code to the project, has authority over it.		gopher.black	70
iThey feel that a majority rule (or at the very minimum,		gopher.black	70
ia consensus of the vocal maintainers) should decide how the		gopher.black	70
iproject proceeds. We see this in a lot of open source projects		gopher.black	70
ithese days, and it's promoted in the form of community guidelines		gopher.black	70
imore and more often. The struggles that happen within communities		gopher.black	70
ias a result of actions against the community guidelines is often		gopher.black	70
ipublic and brutal. In most cases it involves the ostracising of		gopher.black	70
iindividuals and occasionally forks in code bases. In some more		gopher.black	70
iextreme cases it involves doxxing and personal attacks.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn all these cases the problem is pointed at the individual who		gopher.black	70
ibroke outside the line of acceptable behavior according to the		gopher.black	70
igroup. This is bread-and-butter stuff for democracy, especially in		gopher.black	70
ithe age of maximized sensitivity. Let me give you a real example:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iJust a few weeks ago there was honest conversation and debate, in		gopher.black	70
isome places heated, about whether or not a variable name within		gopher.black	70
ithe Mastodon source code should refer to the "dark web" by that		gopher.black	70
iname. Never mind that the dark web is not something named by		gopher.black	70
iMastodon, the community at large converged on the idea that it was		gopher.black	70
iinherently racist because it suggested some sort of evil, and by		gopher.black	70
iincluding the name "dark" it was somehow also inferring that black		gopher.black	70
ipeople are bad. I'm not exaggerating here. This was the actual		gopher.black	70
iconversation and the community as a whole moved in the direction		gopher.black	70
iof "yes, that's racist and we should rename the variable name."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's so many things wrong with the specific argument, but I'm		gopher.black	70
inot going to address them at all. Instead I'm going to focus on		gopher.black	70
ithe structure of community projects themselves. They are almost		gopher.black	70
ialways created by someone. Not some group, some one. Even when		gopher.black	70
ia group is involved, there is almost always a leader, whether		gopher.black	70
idefined or naturally as a part of that group. If the leader is the		gopher.black	70
iultimate decision maker, then these conflicts have an authority		gopher.black	70
iwhich can address issues that arise. If there is no authority, the		gopher.black	70
iissue must be raised to everyone. In many cases, the very act of		gopher.black	70
iraising an issue to everyone is going to escalate that issue, and		gopher.black	70
ionce it is escalated, there's no bringing it back to Earth.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn a group which has an authority, the whims of the masses are		gopher.black	70
inormalized. The fad of the day is quietly passed by and the		gopher.black	70
iproject avoids moving with tides of opinion. If given over to the		gopher.black	70
imob, the loudest will prevail or destroy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDemocracy's lie is that everyone gets an equal voice. This isn't		gopher.black	70
itrue because not everyone is equally aware and equally		gopher.black	70
iunderstands, and has the equal background to make their equal		gopher.black	70
idecision. Instead, the group relies on those who stand tall and		gopher.black	70
ishout to the masses. "Rally around me!" they cry. "I understand		gopher.black	70
iwhat needs to change." And so the democratic individual is		gopher.black	70
ipresented with a choice. It is not a choice born of her natural		gopher.black	70
iinclination and understanding of the world, but a response to		gopher.black	70
ia loud individual. This spark invites other loud individuals to		gopher.black	70
ichime in and steer the conversation. Their voices are not equal		gopher.black	70
istill. The ability to speak may be equal, but that is all.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i(Small aside: I live next to a canal with a lot of wildlife. A fox		gopher.black	70
ijust managed to sneak up on a goose and it is being loudly		gopher.black	70
imurdered outside my window. It's rather distracting.)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhere was I? Oh right.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStallman is in charge of GNU. This is good. Without someone in		gopher.black	70
icharge, GNU would float on the eddies of popular opinion. Instead,		gopher.black	70
iit is a bulwark standing for freedom. Freedom as in liberty.		gopher.black	70
iLiberty, which I've previously discussed, is diametrically opposed		gopher.black	70
ito equality. Of course that's how he runs things. Any other way		gopher.black	70
iwould be as ridiculous as the idea of censoring a joke about the		gopher.black	70
ioverreach of censorship in a project dedicated to fighting fucking		gopher.black	70
icensorship.		gopher.black	70
