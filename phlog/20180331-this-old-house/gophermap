iI'm standing in an empty room facing a large bow window stretching		gopher.black	70
ifrom the rough wooden floor to a rounded arching top. There is		gopher.black	70
isome dust and dirt in the corners and fallen between the floor		gopher.black	70
iboards gapping slightly with age. To my right is a door to the		gopher.black	70
ihallway and eventually roof access. Behind me a closet holds shoe		gopher.black	70
iboxes of memories.		gopher.black	70

iI know the layout of this place intimitely, though I've never		gopher.black	70
ireally been there. It doesn't really exist. In a sense it is my		gopher.black	70
imemory palace [0]. In another sense, it is like the Hi'ngwikan of		gopher.black	70
ithe Lenape people and I am its a-la-pa-cte [1]. It is a private		gopher.black	70
iplace of prayer and solitude where I can organize my thoughts and		gopher.black	70
iintentions.		gopher.black	70

iI don't remember the first time I went there, but I do remember		gopher.black	70
ithat it started with that window. I can still count the panes of		gopher.black	70
iglass, see the smudges of fingerprints I've left, note the		gopher.black	70
iimperfections in the glass as it distorts my view. These details		gopher.black	70
igive it permanence that I find vital. Knowing the texture of the		gopher.black	70
iwood gives me a comfort that I need to let myself be free. It is		gopher.black	70
ithrough that freedom that I find peace.		gopher.black	70

iEarlier today vilmibm posted [2] about what home means to him, and		gopher.black	70
ihow he is able to find it digitally by just finding a quite space		gopher.black	70
iand connecting to his familiar tools, music, and communities.		gopher.black	70
iI love that sentiment. I have anxiety over the question of "where		gopher.black	70
iis home" or "where are you from". I could probably blame the Roma		gopher.black	70
iheritage but that feels like cheating. In reality, I just don't		gopher.black	70
iassociate a physical place with home at all. Though I might wish		gopher.black	70
ian online community or my digital environment to become home like		gopher.black	70
ivilmibm has found, I don't think that fits me either.		gopher.black	70

iNo, my home is a dusty old house with a big bow window that always		gopher.black	70
ihas a different view when I look through it. I know where I keep		gopher.black	70
ithe memories of relationships past (in that closet on the bottom		gopher.black	70
ishelf in a white shoebox), and I know that when I get really sad		gopher.black	70
iI need to go out onto the rooftop garden and greenhouse and let		gopher.black	70
ithe light pour into me. 		gopher.black	70

iTonight I felt some of that sadness coming on. At first I thought		gopher.black	70
iit might mean I was going to have a good evening writing (it's		gopher.black	70
imuch easier for me to write when depressed) but I felt it take		gopher.black	70
ia sour turn in my mind. So, instead of wallowing I spent a little		gopher.black	70
itime in meditation and prayer in my little old house.  No sooner		gopher.black	70
ihad I sat on that dusty floor and placed my hands lightly on the		gopher.black	70
iwooden slats when a cloud broke and a fresh beam of sunlight		gopher.black	70
iwarmed my cheek. Like everything in that place, the symbols speak		gopher.black	70
ia language I understand intuitively. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat sunlight is what I needed tonight. That's how my prayer		gopher.black	70
iworks.		gopher.black	70
