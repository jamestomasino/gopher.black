icmccabe just posted [0] some thoughts on solarpunk as a cultural		gopher.black	70
iphenomenon, as a set of aesthetics surrounding shared goals for		gopher.black	70
ithe future, and as a visual and literary style. It's worth the		gopher.black	70
iquick read. Go check it out, I'll wait here.		gopher.black	70

iAs it so often happens on gopher, his phlog set off a chain of		gopher.black	70
ithought in me that is tangential. It reminded me of a fantastic		gopher.black	70
ibook from last year's reading list [1]:		gopher.black	70

iIn this surprisingly-great book, author Manu Saadia makes a case		gopher.black	70
ifor the true vision of Star Trek future through the lens of the		gopher.black	70
imorals, values, and hard economics that underpin the seriesâ€™ ideal		gopher.black	70
isociety. It's a substantial work that deserves serious attention.		gopher.black	70

iThe utopian future of Star Trek is optimistic and it manages to		gopher.black	70
ichallenge us in many unique ways. It questions our need for		gopher.black	70
ifinancial incentives, the mores of competition vs honor, even the		gopher.black	70
iidea of humanity itself. It also reminds me of that endless		gopher.black	70
iconviction of Doctor Who that underpins everything [2]:		gopher.black	70

iSolarpunk is just this. Yes, there's an artistic aesthetic.		gopher.black	70
iThere's probably something to be claimed as original for		gopher.black	70
ia literary style as well. Ultimately, though, it is a response to		gopher.black	70
ithe gritty, post-modern brutalism of cyberpunk. Instead of the		gopher.black	70
iwastelands of Detroit overrun by cyber-drugs [3], we see green		gopher.black	70
ipasture-lands infused with a shining beacon of optimism in the		gopher.black	70
iform of solar arrays and wind turbines.		gopher.black	70

iI can take or leave Earth Day. It's not a part of solarpunk as		gopher.black	70
imuch as a Delorian topped with a "Mr. Fusion", or as much as a guy		gopher.black	70
ion gopher that powers his farm with a solar array and shares his		gopher.black	70
iwater conservation stories on his phlog [4].		gopher.black	70
