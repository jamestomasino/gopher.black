iThis week I finally got off my bum and contributed something to		gopher.black	70
ithe excellent project over at tilde.tel [0]. This is a small		gopher.black	70
icommunity run by cat [1] which is all about internet phone stuff.		gopher.black	70
iI'm sure many of you gopherites know all about SIP and all that,		gopher.black	70
iso if you want to join and play, he's the man to talk to.		gopher.black	70

iSo what did I contribute? I made a special phone extension (1969)		gopher.black	70
icalled Tilde.Tel Story Time. If you call it you'll get to listen		gopher.black	70
ito me telling you a story. What sorts of stories you might ask?		gopher.black	70
iWell, I'm starting off with Aesop's Fables. So far I've recorded		gopher.black	70
i25 of them, all from the text on project gutenberg.		gopher.black	70

i  Side note: the gopher front-end to project gutenberg seems to		gopher.black	70
i  have exploded into little bits. I forget who was running that.		gopher.black	70
i  Was it you jynx? Anyway, I'd love to link to it again, if that		gopher.black	70
i  gets patched up.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSince some of you aren't internet phone people, and because I'd		gopher.black	70
ihate to lose all the work, I've also archived the stories here on		gopher.black	70
igopher.black. You can find them over at Story Time [2].		gopher.black	70

iIf you listened to Choose Your Own Adventure [3] on anonradio,		gopher.black	70
ithen you know I'm far, far removed from a professional voice guy.		gopher.black	70
i(I have a lisp and stuff) I did clean up the audio a tiny bit, but		gopher.black	70
iI figured it was meant to be heard over phone lines so it is what		gopher.black	70
iit is. I hope you enjoy the recordings. I'll continue to add to		gopher.black	70
ithe collection over time.		gopher.black	70
