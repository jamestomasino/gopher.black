i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt looks like tilde.town recently updated gophernicus, which is		gopher.black	70
iawesome. Many of the servers out there running gophernicus leave		gopher.black	70
ithe bottom footer active for their users, which shows the current		gopher.black	70
igophernicus version that's running.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn my /etc/default/gophernicus I like to disable headers, footers		gopher.black	70
iand the status page hidden at /server-status with the -nt -nh -nf		gopher.black	70
iflags, like so:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOPTIONS="-o UTF-8 -nt -nh -nf -T 7070"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPart of my reasoning is aesthetic. I don't need to show extra crud		gopher.black	70
ion gopher. Part of my reason is security. Not knowing which server		gopher.black	70
iI'm running may make attacks on it more difficult. Not seeing IP		gopher.black	70
iaddresses of users engaged with my system helps them stay		gopher.black	70
ianonymous (server-status related). And part of my reasoning is so		gopher.black	70
iI don't accidentally trip up aggregators.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen you upgrade gophernicus and that version in the footer		gopher.black	70
ichanges, every aggregator out there suddenly thinks you made an		gopher.black	70
iupdate to your phlog. This happens routinely on SDF and suddenly		gopher.black	70
ievery SDF member tracked on my moku-pona [0] sorts to the top of		gopher.black	70
ithe list. Today that happened for our tilde.town users.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIs it a big deal? Oh definitely not. Am I recommending others		gopher.black	70
irunning gophernicus use those switches? It's totally up to them		gopher.black	70
iand I won't harp on the issue. I just want people to be aware that		gopher.black	70
iit's a thing. I suspect many would choose to add the flags if they		gopher.black	70
iknew about the situation, but I won't hold it against you if you		gopher.black	70
idisagree, or simply don't care. Gopher is whatever the hell you		gopher.black	70
iwant to make it.		gopher.black	70

iSpeaking of gopher being whatever the hell you want to make it,		gopher.black	70
iI was surprised to see Ze Libertine Gamer post recently that he		gopher.black	70
imay be deleting his phlog [1]. That's a real shock, to be honest.		gopher.black	70
iHe's got some great content that goes back years. I wonder what		gopher.black	70
isort of things might lead someone to deleting a phlog but not the		gopher.black	70
ientire gopher hole and I'm at a loss. I won't speculate here, but		gopher.black	70
iI will say to ZLG, I really hope you keep it around, even if you		gopher.black	70
idon't update very often. You've got some useful information you've		gopher.black	70
ishared and have been a big part of the community. I'd certainly		gopher.black	70
imiss your contributions.		gopher.black	70

iI agree. WebP does indeed suck. [2] Stop trying to make "fetch"		gopher.black	70
ia thing, Google. Their sleasy method of inserting "switch to		gopher.black	70
imodern image formats" into website performance checkers is dirty		gopher.black	70
iand unwelcome. I don't like blackhat UI and I don't appreciate		gopher.black	70
itheir "disruptions".		gopher.black	70
