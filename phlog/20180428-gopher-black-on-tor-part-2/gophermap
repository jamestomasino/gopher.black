igopher.black on tor, part 2	
iApril 28th, 2018	
i----------------------------------------	
i	
iThis gopher site is finally available as a tor hidden service with	
ithe production onion address: blackgviz2y4nhrd.onion [0]	
i	
1[0] gopher.black (tor)	/	blackgviz2y4nhrd.onion	70
i	
iIn my last post [1] I mentioned three problems I had left:	
1[1] gopher.black on tor, part 1	/phlog/20180427-gopher-black-on-tor-part-1
i	
i1) Ugly onion addresses	
i2) Internal links kick you out of tor	
i3) Port 71	
i	
iHere's how that got resolved.	
i	
iI used Eschalot to generate my onion address. I let the app run	
ia full day trying to get something that started with gopherblack,	
ibut the pattern was too long to find a match. I figure "black" is	
igood enough for folks to remember. I had about	
i15 different ones starting with black, but this had the best	
ilooking pattern.	
i	
iI ended up installing Gophernicus as a second gopher server next	
ito motsognir and configured it to serve up my same content. This	
iinstall was a tiny bit tricky since I already have a service	
ilistenining on port 70. I also wanted Gophernicus to use my tor	
iaddress, not my actual hostname. Finally, I wanted it to run on	
iport 71, but act like links were still port 70. Doing all this	
iinvolved changing 3 files in the repo before I ran make install:	
i	
i  gophernicus.env	
i	
i  Uncomment options and give it the onion host and whatever else	
i  is necessary to your liking: 	
i  	
i    OPTIONS="-h blackgviz2y4nhrd.onion -nf -nt"	
i	
i	
i  gophernicus.socket	
i	
i  Change port to listen on to 71 or 1138 or whatever you'll be	
i  using with the tor proxy.	
i	
i	
i  gophernicus@.service	
i	
i  There's a line in there that looks like this:	
i	
i    ExecStart=/usr/sbin/in.gophernicus -h %H $OPTIONS	
i	
i  Remove the -h %H bit. We set that in options.	
i	
iNow you can 'sudo make install' and it should "Just Work".	
iRemember to update your torrc to use port 70 and proxy to 71. This	
iwill give you your content back on port 70 over tor and all will	
ibe good in the world.	
i	
iThe last hurdle to fix were the internal links. My sexy burrow	
ihelper wants to be a good partner, so it generates gophermaps with	
ifull \tHOST\tPORT\r\n line endings. That's overkill for motsognir	
iand gophernicus, and doesn't allow them the flexibility to add	
ithose bits itself. 	
i	
iOn Motsognir I can exclude the full line ending as long as	
iI prefix the line with type "i" and it will work.	
i	
iOn Gophernicus I can get rid of any type at the start of the line	
iand it will work.	
i	
iTo make both happy I need to include the type "i" at the start of	
ithe line and add a single tab character at the end. Not two tabs	
ior three, just exactly one with nothing after it. This makes both	
iservers happy and lets them fill in the gaps.	
i	
iI'll need to add a switch to burrow to generate this style in the	
ifuture, but in the meantime I can manually clean it up as I add	
iposts.	
i	
ifind . -name "gophermap" -exec sed -i 's/\tgopher.black.*//g' {} \;
