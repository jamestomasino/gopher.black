iWhat a year it's been. I've barely been on gopher or gemini at		gopher.black	70
iall. So much going on!		gopher.black	70

iWhat's eating up all my time? Well, at the start of the year it		gopher.black	70
iwas work, and then getting sick, and then more work as we took on		gopher.black	70
ia whole extra client that we were pretty sure wasn't gonna stick		gopher.black	70
iaround. That turned out to be correct, and by not staffing up to		gopher.black	70
iit we avoided having to fire a bunch of people, which I'm thankful		gopher.black	70
ifor. But then I was spent as well.		gopher.black	70

iSummer happened, some travel, some not travel, things started		gopher.black	70
isettling. Then I traveled for work to a different client thing and		gopher.black	70
igot covid again. That sucked. My cough is mostly gone, finally.		gopher.black	70

iThen I decided to take Icelandic seriously and enrolled in the		gopher.black	70
iUniversity of Iceland in a full-time college program. Now that's		gopher.black	70
idominating my mornings all week every week, followed by my job		gopher.black	70
idominating the afternoon and evenings. In the small gaps I get		gopher.black	70
ithat aren't filled with study, I've been playing in a few TTRPG		gopher.black	70
igames. Well, running them, mostly, but that counts as play.		gopher.black	70

iI'm in my last regular week of classes now, and final exams are		gopher.black	70
itwo & three weeks out. Then I have the holiday break before the		gopher.black	70
isecond semester. Thankfully this is only a two semester program,		gopher.black	70
iso by June I'll be back to my own life again.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh! and Season 2 of Solarpunk Prompts has started up. I'm writing		gopher.black	70
iand recording that somewhere in the middle of everything else.		gopher.black	70

iI miss you, gopher! I'll be back, I promise. *sigh*		gopher.black	70
