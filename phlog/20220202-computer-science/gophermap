i		gopher.black	70
iI came across one of those lists of free computer science classes		gopher.black	70
icurated in a github gist or some other such place. I knocked it		gopher.black	70
iaround in my tabs for a couple hours and let my mind go back to my		gopher.black	70
iown CS education.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI started at Rowan University in 1998 in the Computer Science		gopher.black	70
idepartment following the coattails of a friend from Boy Scouts who		gopher.black	70
ihad been doing well for a year already. In high school I didn't		gopher.black	70
ireally have any direction at all or idea of what I wanted to do.		gopher.black	70
iComputers happened to be a thing I was familiar with, spent a bit		gopher.black	70
iof time on, and it appeared likely to have a future that paid		gopher.black	70
iwell. My dad's only restriction on my choice was, "No art."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHe had gone to Kent State and studied in the Visual Communications		gopher.black	70
idepartment there and was unable to turn that into a career. He		gopher.black	70
iinstead took the long way through a retail job and eventually into		gopher.black	70
isales. Because of his experience he hoped to save me the trouble.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe thing is, had he not had that restriction I likely would have		gopher.black	70
igone into some form of art education. It was the course track		gopher.black	70
iI enjoyed most in school, continuously excelled in, and got me		gopher.black	70
imotivated. But, in the long run the joke is on both of us. As I'll		gopher.black	70
iexplain in a moment. But first, back to Computer Science!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn 1998 I got my start. I had some great introduction to		gopher.black	70
iprogramming classes that dove right into C. I had a killer lab		gopher.black	70
itechniques practical course that taught me the ins and outs of the		gopher.black	70
icommand line, jobs, rediection of outputs, and all sorts of mighty		gopher.black	70
icool things I use every day. I also had some heavy-duty math		gopher.black	70
iclasses which bored the ever-living snot out of me.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy first semester went well. My second semester saw a marked dip		gopher.black	70
iin my grades, though. I was getting involved in stuff that was		gopher.black	70
itaking my focus away from class, and part way through that year		gopher.black	70
iI developed an extreme clinical depression and insomnia. Entering		gopher.black	70
imy sophomore years I find it difficult to relate details because		gopher.black	70
iI have some intense memory loss due to the insomnia. I basically		gopher.black	70
iaccomplished nothing is school, failed everything, and was on the		gopher.black	70
iedge of academic probation when I somehow signed up to enlist in		gopher.black	70
ithe US Navy. That gave me an excuse for a leave-of-asence from		gopher.black	70
ischool (delaying repaying those loans!) and in a matter of weeks		gopher.black	70
iI was gone.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAll in all my computer science education is the equivalent of two		gopher.black	70
ipretty solid semesters of foundations.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the Navy I was a nuclear electronics technician, so I picked up		gopher.black	70
imore skills in hardware which was really cool, but didn't do much		gopher.black	70
ito further my computer expertise.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFinally, after the Navy, I ended up returning to school and		gopher.black	70
ibeginning anew at Indiana University. I transfered pretty much		gopher.black	70
inothing from my first school as I wasn't going into a CS		gopher.black	70
idepartment. I think 2 of my math classes may have worked and		gopher.black	70
ithat's it. But, this time around I had a Navy work ethic and also		gopher.black	70
ithe a limited time payment due to my medical discharge. The Navy		gopher.black	70
ihad me covered for about 3 years of school, so I went to town.		gopher.black	70
iI managed to go from nothing at all to a masters degree in those		gopher.black	70
ithree years. Fun part about it? It was in this lovely new program		gopher.black	70
ithat just launched called "New Media". It was, in fact, a visual		gopher.black	70
icommunications degree + computers. Hah!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, as I'm remember all this stuff I'm also lementing how I can		gopher.black	70
iwhiz through and code really well and professionally at a senior		gopher.black	70
ilevel in a few niche areas, but if you need skills that get past,		gopher.black	70
isay, data structures and algorithms level, I never learned it.		gopher.black	70
iSystems programming? No idea. Operating systems? Nope. Parallel		gopher.black	70
icomputing? Huh?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'll sum it up this way: I never got to learn how to link to		gopher.black	70
ia system library. Not sure what to do to make that happen.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI can muddle around in about 15 languages, but without that		gopher.black	70
iconceptual level to fall back on there's not a lot I can actually		gopher.black	70
iDO outside of the web.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo yeah, I need more education. And here are all these free		gopher.black	70
icourses. My formal education was a quarter century ago, so I'm not		gopher.black	70
igoing to rely on memory. I've decided to start from the beginning.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe following is a list of courses with video lections I found		gopher.black	70
iwhich roughly run in linear order. I may end up shuffling one or		gopher.black	70
itwo things later on, but for now I'm just watching lectures one by		gopher.black	70
ione and soaking it in. I'm pretty sure I won't need any note		gopher.black	70
itaking for the first couple of courses, but we'll see.		gopher.black	70
