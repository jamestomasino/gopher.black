iA fedi post from @DL6MHC@mastodon.radio I just read said:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i"I've started to abuse Amazon for browsing articles, getting		gopher.black	70
iinspirations, reading (hopefully non-fake) reviews and finding out		gopher.black	70
iwhat a solid price for an article is. Then I buy my stuff		gopher.black	70
isomewhere else."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFor years I would go to big booksellers like Barnes & Noble or		gopher.black	70
iBorders (before it shut down) to browse books and discover		gopher.black	70
iinteresting things only to then purchase them online from Amazon		gopher.black	70
iwhere it was much cheaper. Sometimes I'd even purchase while I was		gopher.black	70
istill there browsing. I felt so clever.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy battle then was against the big bookseller who came in and		gopher.black	70
ikilled so many beloved tiny bookshops. Amazon was the scrappy		gopher.black	70
ialternative in my mind, and a means of revenge.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThese days I will browse Amazon for things, read reviews, gather		gopher.black	70
iintel, and then purchase else where, just like the fedi user		gopher.black	70
iabove. I wish I could say that it was an act of will power and		gopher.black	70
iethical justice at work, but it's mostly because ordering from		gopher.black	70
iAmazon to Iceland is prohibitively expensive.		gopher.black	70

iI take solace in the world of coffee, though. When Starbucks swept		gopher.black	70
iin and killed many of my beloved local coffee shops I did not bow		gopher.black	70
idown, but fought back by supporting those who remained or		gopher.black	70
iabstaining completely. When the third wave of coffee brought back		gopher.black	70
ithe renaissance of local shops I was ready to dive right in. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut books... sadly, my options are less stellar. For one thing		gopher.black	70
iI try not to gather too many physical books. I can't move them		gopher.black	70
ieasily or cheaply and I end up giving them away. So I favor ebooks		gopher.black	70
ior library books. Those I could still get cheaply from Amazon,		gopher.black	70
iI suppose. The general mentality that "Amazon isn't affordable"		gopher.black	70
iI've developed here seems to have clouded that issue in my head.		gopher.black	70
iI'm more likely to seek a 3rd party site, direct-from-author		gopher.black	70
ipurchase, or grab from the library. For older works, out-of-print		gopher.black	70
istuff, or obscure things I dust off my tor browser and visit		gopher.black	70
iz-library.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnyway, not sure where I was going with this, but there ya go.		gopher.black	70
