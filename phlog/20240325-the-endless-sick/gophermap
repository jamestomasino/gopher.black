iUgh, I'm so tired of being sick. I took a trip to the US for		gopher.black	70
ia weekend and brought back the flu. It raged for a few days and		gopher.black	70
ithen settled into my lungs. Now it's nearly a month later and I'm		gopher.black	70
istill working up all the crap inside me.		gopher.black	70

iI felt like an extra big dummy on Wednesday, though. I was talking		gopher.black	70
ito someone about the shakuhachi [0] and I sent them a link to some		gopher.black	70
ipractice I had recorded a couple years ago [1]. The name of the		gopher.black	70
irecording was Breathing Exercises 2. And that's when it hit me!		gopher.black	70
iI used shakuhachi practice to strengthen my lungs and recover		gopher.black	70
iafter covid. Why haven't I been doing it after this stupid flu?		gopher.black	70
iComplete idiot, this guy right here.		gopher.black	70

iWell, I've been good about putting in practice every day since		gopher.black	70
ithen and while I'm still coughing my chest has started feeling		gopher.black	70
imore in control. The amount of phlegm I'm working up in		gopher.black	70
iincreasing. Hopefully I'll feel good again in time for whatever		gopher.black	70
inext trip I need to take so I can get sick again.		gopher.black	70
