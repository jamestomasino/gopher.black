iI've run a little disallow robots.txt file on this gopher hole for		gopher.black	70
ia while. Now there's been more discussion about its inclusion on		gopher.black	70
igopher for gopher search engines. This leads me to a little		gopher.black	70
iproblem.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy robots.txt file is not meant for gopher crawlers. I created it		gopher.black	70
ibecause I do not want my site crawled by web crawlers trawling		gopher.black	70
ithrough proxies to gopher. There's some question as to whether		gopher.black	70

ishould have one, not the site itself), but I thought it better		gopher.black	70
ithan nothing.		gopher.black	70

iNow I have a dilemma. I would very much like my site to be crawled		gopher.black	70
iby Veronica-2 and other gopher-centric search engines, but I don't		gopher.black	70
iwant Google plopping my burrowy-thoughts on the web. What's		gopher.black	70
