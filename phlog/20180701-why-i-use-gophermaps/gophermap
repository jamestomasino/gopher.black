ixmanmonk just asked why I use gophermaps for my phlog instead of		gopher.black	70
iplain text. I know others at bitreich [0] have commented on the		gopher.black	70
ipractice with various opinions on why "misusing" gophermaps is		gopher.black	70
ibad. Plenty of people on gopher use plain text for their content		gopher.black	70
iand I am not going to complain. My choice is a product of style		gopher.black	70
iand philosophy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStyle:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOne of the best things about hypertext is the ability to link		gopher.black	70
icontextually to relevant content. Gopher is missing this to		gopher.black	70
ia degree, but not entirely. We can't link a block of text inline		gopher.black	70
ilike in HTML but we can link a line. That functionality is		gopher.black	70
ientirely limited to gophermaps, though. Without the gophermap the		gopher.black	70
ibest we can do is include a text link and rely on the client to go		gopher.black	70
iabove and beyond the protocol to enable interaction (like VF-1 so		gopher.black	70
ivaliantly does).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy choice, stylistically, was to take it upon myself to do		gopher.black	70
ia little extra work and build in the links directly into the		gopher.black	70
icontent by making my phlogs a gophermap. I first announced this		gopher.black	70
ichange [1] back in October of 2017 when I was still relatively new		gopher.black	70
iat this whole thing. In fact, I was piggybacking on the very		gopher.black	70
ibare-bones shell scripts that would later become burrow [2]. My		gopher.black	70
ifirst iteration was just a bunch of echo commands to a blank file		gopher.black	70
iand then launching vim [3]. These days I have the ability to edit		gopher.black	70
iexisting phlog entries, generate in plain text or gophermaps,		gopher.black	70
iauto-generate RSS, and a bunch of other crap.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPhilosophy:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFrom what I've seen over my time on gopher the biggest complaint		gopher.black	70
iabout gophermaps for content isn't about the effort involved in		gopher.black	70
icreating them. Instead it's an argument for purity in the		gopher.black	70
iprotocol. "Don't use the 'i' item type for this sort of thing,"		gopher.black	70
ithey say. "The 'i' type isn't even in RFC 1436!" And it's true.		gopher.black	70
iThe type isn't defined in 1436, and it definitely isn't pure		gopher.black	70
igopher as envisioned in the two-week sprint that a bunch of guys		gopher.black	70
iat the University of Minnesota did as much to stick it to the man		gopher.black	70
i(their school beauracracy) as they did to just get something out		gopher.black	70
ithere for the community to react to.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSee, I don't see that as something to protect through purity. The		gopher.black	70
imindset of those guys was to iterate, to share, to build, and to		gopher.black	70
imake the internet better. They didn't sit for years in planning		gopher.black	70
ibefore deploying the end-all-be-all of protocols. They cobbled		gopher.black	70
itogether some crap on top of existing tools and made improvements.		gopher.black	70
iAnd that's what type "i" did later. It enabled us to write more		gopher.black	70
idescription than would fit on one line so there was context to		gopher.black	70
ia link.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's what I see myself doing when I phlog. The links below (and		gopher.black	70
inow sometimes in-line) are given context by my post. If you're		gopher.black	70
ireading and say, "hey, I should check that out!" now you can. You		gopher.black	70
ijust follow the link and boom, there you are.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFor those folks who don't bother with it and post in plain text,		gopher.black	70
iif I really want to chase down a link I can select it and manually		gopher.black	70
ienter it. It's more difficult, but it's doable. I hold no grudge		gopher.black	70
iagainst them for their choice.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you are new to gopher and just want to toss up markdown files		gopher.black	70
ithat you're also using to generate a web version, go for it. I'll		gopher.black	70
ibe more happy that you've decided to add content here than		gopher.black	70
ianything else. I'm certainly not going to berate your efforts by		gopher.black	70
init-picking on whether you use type 1 or type 0. 		gopher.black	70
