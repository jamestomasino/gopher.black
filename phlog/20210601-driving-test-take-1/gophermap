iI took my written driving test on Monday. I did not pass.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis isn't a surprise, though. In fact, it's the norm! My wife		gopher.black	70
ialso failed to pass on Monday and it was her second attempt. No		gopher.black	70
ione in the room passed during her first testing. Only one person		gopher.black	70
ipassed on the day we took it together.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhy is that? Well, it's a very hard test! The driving exam in		gopher.black	70
iIceland covers a lot more material and subject matter than		gopher.black	70
ianything I saw in the United States in the various states I lived		gopher.black	70
iin. It also goes into greater detail on those topics and is		gopher.black	70
iincredibly pedantic. Do _you_ know the minimum mm depth tire tread		gopher.black	70
ican be to pass inspection? Do you know the maximum towing capacity		gopher.black	70
ifor your driving license class? There are also quite a few		gopher.black	70
iquestions about insurance policies, the various road and safety		gopher.black	70
iagencies and their roles, and even first aid.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe reason we didn't pass, though, is not just because of the		gopher.black	70
imaterial, but the scoring itself. The test is 30 questions long		gopher.black	70
iwith part A being the first 15 and mainly being focused on signage		gopher.black	70
iwhile part B is the second 15 and is focused on everything else.		gopher.black	70
iYou are allowed two mistakes on part A and five mistakes on part		gopher.black	70
iB. Any mistakes unused on part A can be applied to part B, such		gopher.black	70
ithat if you had no mistakes on A you can have up to 7 on B.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut what constitutes a mistake? Ahh, here's where things get		gopher.black	70
itricky. The questions are multiple choice and you mark a mistake		gopher.black	70
ifor each incorrect response, not each incorrect question. Since		gopher.black	70
ieach question has three choices that means you can get three		gopher.black	70
imistakes per question!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn fact, that's what I did to fail mine. I got everything correct		gopher.black	70
ion the test in both sections except for a single question on		gopher.black	70
isection A where I misidentified a road marking, choosing option		gopher.black	70
i"C" while the correct answer was "A & B". Thus, 3 mistakes on one		gopher.black	70
iquestion and a fail.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'll test again at the end of the month and hopefully pass this		gopher.black	70
itime around. Once that's done I still have to meet with a driving		gopher.black	70
iinstructor, deal with their manditory lessons, and then finally be		gopher.black	70
iallowed to take the behind-the-wheel portion of the exam. Yeesh!		gopher.black	70
