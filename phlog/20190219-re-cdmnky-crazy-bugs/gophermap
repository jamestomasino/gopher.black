iHere's a couple techniques I've learned over the years to punch		gopher.black	70
ithose sassy bugs that just won't go away square in the face-hole.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Explain that part of the program bit by bit to someone		gopher.black	70
i   unfamiliar with it. It can be someone else in your class, or on		gopher.black	70
i   your team, or just someone you know. They don't need to be		gopher.black	70
i   coders. Just explain to them the logic of what you're doing and		gopher.black	70
i   walk them through that part out loud.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Often this will reveal your mistake sideways. You'll probably		gopher.black	70
i   catch yourself just before you say the next part out loud as		gopher.black	70
i   you unconsciously see the disconnect between what you expected		gopher.black	70
i   to see and what's there. It's frustrating that it works, but it		gopher.black	70
i   does. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Don't let a full hour go by debugging a single issue without		gopher.black	70
i   trying this.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i2. Delete it and rewrite it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   No, shut-up. Just do it. I don't care that it SHOULD work.		gopher.black	70
i   I don't care that you're just going to type it again exactly		gopher.black	70
i   like the first time. Do it. Right, effing, now.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Does it work? Oh hells yes. Will it make you angry when it		gopher.black	70
i   does? Fuck yes.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Don't let half a day go by debugging a single issue without		gopher.black	70
i   trying this.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. Try to solve something else.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Take a break and work on a different thing if you can. Put it		gopher.black	70
i   out of your brain. Give a day to another project or subject or		gopher.black	70
i   call in sick with the butt-flu. Get some distance.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   It's not as reliable a fix as the first two, but it can do the		gopher.black	70
i   trick. This is great if your issues is on a side-project or		gopher.black	70
i   hobby that's not under a pressing deadline. Go wind surfing, or		gopher.black	70
i   try to research different types of furry sub-culture, or		gopher.black	70
i   binge-watch the old MTV cartoon "Clone High" so I can make		gopher.black	70
i   jokes that people will get.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThose are my big 3. Maybe some others out there have		gopher.black	70
irecommendations for you as well?		gopher.black	70
