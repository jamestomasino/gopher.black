iThis is a part of a series of phlog entries where I will share		gopher.black	70
isome of my command line tricks, tips, and scripts.		gopher.black	70

iFitness trackers are all the rage. Chances are that you've got one		gopher.black	70
ion you right now, weirdo. Collecting data about your own behavior		gopher.black	70
iis pretty neat. It's extra cool if you can do it in a way that		gopher.black	70
idoesn't also give that data away to nefarious strangers who want		gopher.black	70
ito take over the world, but I digress.		gopher.black	70

iI like tracking my shiz too. I've used my phone to count steps in		gopher.black	70
ithe past, and I have a scale in my bathroom, and a tape-measure		gopher.black	70
ifor my big belly. But where do I save those numbers so I can look		gopher.black	70
iback on my amazing progress of awesomeness later? I don't really		gopher.black	70
iwant to hand that over to Google or MyFitnessPal. They don't need		gopher.black	70
ito know that stuff. I could just store it in text files for myself		gopher.black	70
iand parse them later.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd that's exactly what I decided to do. I keep some csv files in		gopher.black	70
idropbox, or in nextcloud, or in syncthing. But logging stuff in		gopher.black	70
iCSV files isn't really fun, so I wrote a little tracker app to		gopher.black	70
ihelp me out.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow you can enjoy the glory of my crappy little program too!		gopher.black	70
iFirst, grab a copy over on github [0] and install it.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iIt's really easy to use. Start by checking the man page or		gopher.black	70
ispitting out some help:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ man track		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  $ track -h		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSee how to use it? Great! You're done!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut seriously, it is really basic. You can just add a new metric		gopher.black	70
ito track by tracking something to it for the first time. It allows		gopher.black	70
ionly one data point per day. It doesn't care what format that data		gopher.black	70
iis in.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's probably easy ways to break it, so, um, don't do those.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDo you have something you want to add to it to make it better?		gopher.black	70
iCool! Make a pull request and gimme-gimme. I probably want that		gopher.black	70
ifeature too.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh, as a side-note, the data I used in my post "Fat" [1] all was		gopher.black	70
ilogged with this script. I have an example in that post of how to		gopher.black	70
igenerate a graph on the command line using the jp utility. Check		gopher.black	70
iit out.		gopher.black	70
