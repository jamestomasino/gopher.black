i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThanks to the hard work of pople like dbucklin, deepend and		gopher.black	70
ivilmibm, we now have net news (read: USENET without the spam)		gopher.black	70
iinstalled and working on cosmic.voyage AND it peers with		gopher.black	70
inews.tildeverse.org and tilde.team! This is huge, folks.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTo run it on cosmic, just type 'news'. I made a little wrapper		gopher.black	70
iaround slrn that handles creating a configuration file and		gopher.black	70
idownloading group descriptions. You can also run it from 'menu'.		gopher.black	70
iBut that's not what I want to talk about on this phlog. Instead,		gopher.black	70
iI'm going to _try_ to capture all the stuff I did to get it		gopher.black	70
iworking. INN2 is not exactly intuitive to set up.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFirst, the caveats:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- This install is on Ubuntu. Your milage may vary.		gopher.black	70
i- Peering is working for NEW messages, but we don't have historics		gopher.black	70
i  syncing across systems yet. It probably has something to do with		gopher.black	70
i  control messages.		gopher.black	70
i- Peering requires both parties to set this up. You can't just set		gopher.black	70
i  up your system to watch another. Each host must explicitly send		gopher.black	70
i  to another AND listen for incoming messages from other specific		gopher.black	70
i  hosts.		gopher.black	70
i- You must have created the local groups on your system that you		gopher.black	70
i  want to receive messages. They're not created automatically.		gopher.black	70
i  Again, this is probably a function of control messages that we		gopher.black	70
i  haven't figured out yet.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow, configuration:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Install inn2. In Ubuntu it's just apt install inn2. On openbsd		gopher.black	70
i  you will need to use the --without-openssl switch or it will die		gopher.black	70
i  on make.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Make sure that the 'news' user is created and all the folder		gopher.black	70
i  paths listed in inn2's INSTALL file exist. If doing this via apt		gopher.black	70
i  you should be good to go.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Files for configuration are mostly in /etc/news/ with one		gopher.black	70
i  exception in /var/lib/news which we'll deal with at the end. If		gopher.black	70
i  you're not on Ubuntu/Debian, the paths may be different. See		gopher.black	70
i  INSTALL for a mapping by system.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- /etc/news/inn.conf  # this is the main config		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Changes:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  organization: this is a site description in quotes		gopher.black	70
i  pathhost, domain, server: all should be your fqdn		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- /etc/news/incoming.conf  # where to listen for new incoming data		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  At the bottom, follow this convention:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  peer ME {		gopher.black	70
i    hostname:         "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  peer tildeverse {		gopher.black	70
i    hostname:         "news.tildeverse.org"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  peer team {		gopher.black	70
i    hostname:         "tilde.team"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- /etc/news/innfeed.conf  # where are we sending our data		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Define peers here. ip-name is the only required field:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  peer team {		gopher.black	70
i      ip-name: tilde.team		gopher.black	70
i      initial-connections: 2		gopher.black	70
i      max-connections: 5		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  peer tildeverse		gopher.black	70
i  {		gopher.black	70
i      ip-name: news.tildeverse.org		gopher.black	70
i      initial-connections: 2		gopher.black	70
i      max-connections: 5		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- /etc/news/newsfeeds   # defines what we send to whom		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This is the most complex file and hardest to grok. Note the		gopher.black	70
i  !cosmic.* lines in the peers. That keeps cosmic's local groups		gopher.black	70
i  (which start with cosmic.) from sending to remotes. Change it up		gopher.black	70
i  for your own system.		gopher.black	70
