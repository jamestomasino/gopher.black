A wedding and a funeral
September 21st, 2017
----------------------------------------

A friend's father passed away this week and we'll be going to his viewing
tomorrow night. The following day we head up to Buffalo for the wedding of my
wife's friend. I'm experiencing some ineffable feelings about the
juxtaposition.

I won't waste time in trying to explain the unexplainable. Instead, if you're
reading this and not in a great hurry, give me thirty seconds of your time.
Take a relaxed position and think of two friends. Surround one with an
experience of unabashed joy and the other in inconsolable sorrow. Picture it
clearly for a moment, then think on your reaction to both, your desire stemming
from both. I'll wait for you.

There's something there that's more than the sum of its parts.
