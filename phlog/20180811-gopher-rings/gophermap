i<zlg> Places like Bongusta and phlogroll remind me of web-rings		gopher.black	70
ifrom the 1990s. Let's name'em gopher-rings, or perhaps gopher dens		gopher.black	70
iif we want to be cute. They serve the same function: building		gopher.black	70
ia network with volunteer participants (the curation process) and		gopher.black	70
itechnology that empowers the individual (self-hosting and		gopher.black	70
imoku-pona). What do you think, #gopher?		gopher.black	70

itfurrows [1] also posted a semi-related phlog [2] today on		gopher.black	70
ifavorites and the tools that engineer our interactions.		gopher.black	70

iI started thinking about a response on Mastodon, but my head		gopher.black	70
iflooded with too many things to fit in 500 characters. A phlog is		gopher.black	70
ia better medium, I think.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the nascent web we had many ways of finding each other and		gopher.black	70
iother content that seems archaic or obtuse in retrospect. In the		gopher.black	70
ivery earliest days I kept a paper notebook where I manually wrote		gopher.black	70
idown email addresses and websites. Later web-rings became popular		gopher.black	70
iways to link like-content to one another, forming communities from		gopher.black	70
ithe ether. By the time search engines came online we had all sorts		gopher.black	70
iof other ways to bridge the gaps.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think back to my time using AltaVista, or Lycos, or Yahoo!,		gopher.black	70
ifinding them awkward and lacking, and returning to the advice of		gopher.black	70
ia webring or forum to find real relevant sites. I would cast		gopher.black	70
ia broader net using a meta-search engine like SavvySearch and		gopher.black	70
iclick through pages and pages of results. That method of exploring		gopher.black	70
ithe web didn't take over in prominance for me, personally, until		gopher.black	70
iGoogle began their takeover.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWeb-rings fell to the wayside quickly as "googling" entered the		gopher.black	70
ilexicon, and I don't think I consciously realized the		gopher.black	70
i"engineering" or "channeled usage", as tfurrows puts it, was so		gopher.black	70
ibroadly affecting my behavior until very recently. In my head,		gopher.black	70
isearch engines are tools and I use them. If I am careful to avoid		gopher.black	70
itracking behaviors, they don't use me, right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWell, maybe not. Google's algorithms, or a browser's "favorites"		gopher.black	70
iscreen guides our hand and our habits in a major way. We engage		gopher.black	70
iwith what we see and what we find, and that is a power that		gopher.black	70
ishouldn't be forgotten.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo, thinking on ze libertine gamer's idea, I think the gopher		gopher.black	70
iaggregators, the gopher-rings, are very much a throwback to the		gopher.black	70
iold days when communities were more manually linked to one		gopher.black	70
ianother. There is still a power inherent in the tools we use, no		gopher.black	70
idifferent than Google wields, or Firefox, but because it's curated		gopher.black	70
iby participants in the community (like me!), I feel better about		gopher.black	70
iit. Our micro-aggregators aren't monolithic. Anyone can run one,		gopher.black	70
ithanks to the awesome utilities shared around the community.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy phlog roll [3] began as a personal tool for me to track the		gopher.black	70
iphlogs I read. It's become a very popular starting point for		gopher.black	70
iothers as well, and so I added some language to the top on how to		gopher.black	70
iget new sites added. Inclusion on my aggregator is open to all, as		gopher.black	70
ilong as your phlog is in a format that moku-pona can handle.		gopher.black	70
iI don't want to be a barrier to finding gopher content; I want to		gopher.black	70
ibe an easy entry-point. 		gopher.black	70

iHave a site that you want added? Drop me an email at one of the		gopher.black	70
iaddresses in my contact page on this gopher hole, or reach out on		gopher.black	70
iMastodon. I try to watch SDF, grex, and the tilde communities for		gopher.black	70
inew holes that pop up so I can add them quickly. I generally wait		gopher.black	70
iuntil a phlog has at least two posts before I add it to avoid the		gopher.black	70
i"hello world" phenomenon that litters SDF. Just hit me up if you		gopher.black	70
isee something missing.		gopher.black	70
