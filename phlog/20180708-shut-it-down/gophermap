iSometimes the little frustrations add up and spill over. I tend to		gopher.black	70
iget very quiet when I'm at my breaking point. I shut down. I walk		gopher.black	70
iaway. When I was young I'd walk away in grandiose ways: from		gopher.black	70
irelationships, jobs, responsibility. I've learned how to siphon		gopher.black	70
ioff the steam before reaching that point. I meditate, I walk,		gopher.black	70
iI pray. I can roll with it a lot more than when I was a kid.		gopher.black	70

idown and walk away from my life. It's not a rational thought. My		gopher.black	70
ilife is pretty damn good. The frustrations are minor things,		gopher.black	70

inot rational, as I said, and it's not logical.		gopher.black	70
