iI've added a bunch of new people to my personal moku-pona list	
ilately. Thanks to tfurrows for mentioning c25l recently. I had no	
iidea (s)he was around and there's so much to read! Also, tfurrows,	
isince you have different phlogs on different gopher holes I've	
iadded each of yours separately to my lists. Yargo too gets two	
imentions. Anyone else running multiple phlogs that I should be	
itracking?
