iI've been geeking out hard all day about RFCs. Someone on Mastodon
iposted about how CSV as a format was never needed and only came
iinto existence because people at IBM and Bell Labs never read
iRFC20 [0], the definition of ASCII. ASCII has in its character set
ifields for separating ... fields, and groups and rows. 4 levels of
iheirarchy, to be exact. With those we never needed to worry about
iproperly quoting stuff in CSV!
i
iMind. Blown.
i
iSo I tore through it (it's a short RFC) and it was a fascinating
iwindow into the past. I felt exactly as I had as a kid when I saw
ithe Declaration of Independence. This was a marker in history,
ia relic of communication. The old RFCs feel like that to me.
i
iI know I felt that way when I read RFC1436: The Internet Gopher
iProtocol [1]. I guess RFCs are cool things to go read for fun.
iHuh, who knew?
i
iAnyway, to kind-of "celebrate" my nerdy excitement, I'm going to
iadopt using 1436 as a synonym for Gopher. Now you know what I'm
ireferring to if you ever see that in the future. Maybe I'll link
iback here the first couple times... yeah.
i
iJoin me in 1436ing!
