 1436
 March 01st, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I've been geeking out hard all day about RFCs. Someone on Mastodon
 posted about how CSV as a format was never needed and only came
 into existence because people at IBM and Bell Labs never read
 RFC20 [0], the definition of ASCII. ASCII has in its character set
 fields for separating ... fields, and groups and rows. 4 levels of
 heirarchy, to be exact. With those we never needed to worry about
 properly quoting stuff in CSV!
 
 Mind. Blown.
 
 So I tore through it (it's a short RFC) and it was a fascinating
 window into the past. I felt exactly as I had as a kid when I saw
 the Declaration of Independence. This was a marker in history,
 a relic of communication. The old RFCs feel like that to me.
 
 I know I felt that way when I read RFC1436: The Internet Gopher
 Protocol [1]. I guess RFCs are cool things to go read for fun.
 Huh, who knew?
 
 Anyway, to kind-of "celebrate" my nerdy excitement, I'm going to
 adopt using 1436 as a synonym for Gopher. Now you know what I'm
 referring to if you ever see that in the future. Maybe I'll link
 back here the first couple times... yeah.
 
 Join me in 1436ing!
