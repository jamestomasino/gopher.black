iThe restoration of gopher.black was quite eventful with some		gopher.black	70
iabsolutely awful computer drama. If you care about such things,		gopher.black	70
ihere's a recap:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI have a few raspberry pis, model 3s and some zero Ws. One of them		gopher.black	70
ihas this sick metal case with a fan. It's a beast. Used that		gopher.black	70
ihardware for gopher.black along with a 64gb micro sd card. The		gopher.black	70
ionly problem is, the fan sucks (or blows?). It has always been		gopher.black	70
ireally noisy, and it eventually pissed me off enough to do		gopher.black	70
isomething about it. Since the pis don't run hot anyway, I figured		gopher.black	70
iit was unnecessary. But before I removed it completely I figured		gopher.black	70
iI'd try lubricating it just in case that solved things.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt didn't.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo I opened the case up, ripped that bad boy out, and plugged her		gopher.black	70
iback in. Only this time, something was wrong. I was up and		gopher.black	70
irunning, but the system was in read-only mode. Uh, oh! I decided		gopher.black	70
ito reboot and try again. This time, even worse... no boot.		gopher.black	70
iI plugged in an HDMI monitor to watch the boot sequence and it		gopher.black	70
isprawled a bunch of messages about read-only crap. A quick google		gopher.black	70
irevealed that my SD card was likely at fault. It was going bad.		gopher.black	70
iI assume it was related to me opening the thing up and closing it		gopher.black	70
ia few times. I must have bumped it badly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf the card was read-only, I figured I could still read it to get		gopher.black	70
ian image. I did some dd magic and backed it up. Today I got a new		gopher.black	70
i64GB sd card in the mail. I dd'd my backup onto that and plugged		gopher.black	70
iit in but nothing happened. Not even a failed boot. Just nada.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI thought... Lets make sure it's the SD card! So I swapped my SD		gopher.black	70
icard from my pi-hole and gopher.black into the other hardware and		gopher.black	70
iconfirmed... definitely the SD. I had to roll back to an earlier		gopher.black	70
ibackup. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe most recent I had was from June (yuck). Luckily, 90% of the		gopher.black	70
icrap on gopher.black is in git, so it's just a matter of updating		gopher.black	70
ifrom repos after restoring things. I smiled to myself at my own		gopher.black	70
iawesome and went over to my PC which houses the older backups.		gopher.black	70
iI plugged in my new SD card, opened up Etcher to image it from the		gopher.black	70
ibackup and POOF, the MOTHERFUCKING drive hosting my backups		gopher.black	70
idecided that it was the perfect moment to disappear!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFast forward a bit to me restoring that drive from ITS backup,		gopher.black	70
ieventually restoring my SD card from the old backup, plugging		gopher.black	70
ithings into the pi, booting it up, and we're back in business.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThings that still suck:		gopher.black	70
i- Moku Pona is running again, but pretty much EVERYTHING updated		gopher.black	70
i  since June, so the most recent phlogs is kinda a mess. It'll		gopher.black	70
i  sort itself out in the days to come.		gopher.black	70
i- All my web certs expired. I'm renewing them again now via		gopher.black	70
i  acme.sh.		gopher.black	70
i- Weechat's sec.conf does something weird. It doesn't know my		gopher.black	70
i  master password. I have no idea what logic it uses, but this is		gopher.black	70
i  the second time that's happened to me in a week. I appreciate		gopher.black	70
i  that it externalizes passwords, but that's just BS. I'm better		gopher.black	70
i  off typing them in each time I connect. It's not like I do it		gopher.black	70
i  very often.		gopher.black	70
i- Probably other stuff... I don't really recall everything I did		gopher.black	70
i  on gopher.black over the last couple months. I'm sure most of it		gopher.black	70
i  was content, but maybe there was something else that was super		gopher.black	70
i  cool and I totally forgot. Meh, we'll make due.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you notice anything wonky on my stuff in the next couple days,		gopher.black	70
ihit me up.		gopher.black	70
