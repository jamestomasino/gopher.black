iIn 1997, Modo & Modo reintroduced the Moleskine notebooks to the		gopher.black	70
iworld, taking the design from 19th & 20th century french designs		gopher.black	70
ias described in the writings of Bruce Chatwin. There's a lot of		gopher.black	70
imystique surrounding the design and use, but what they really		gopher.black	70
irepresent is a mass-market blank book with a solid design for		gopher.black	70
ipocket use.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI started carrying Moleskine notebooks in 1998 and still carry		gopher.black	70
ithem today. In fact, in 2001 I bulk ordered them and have		gopher.black	70
ia stockpile stored away just in case something weird happens in		gopher.black	70
iItaly. They're fantastic books, not because of some magical		gopher.black	70
iquality of manufacturing or design, but because they are cheap and		gopher.black	70
imoderately well constructed. If they were built to last I would		gopher.black	70
ihave a harder time using them. That's the point I want to get at		gopher.black	70
iin this phlog.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen I first started keeping a journal it was just that, a diary.		gopher.black	70
iI wrote thoughts in it and dated them. They were serious and		gopher.black	70
iheartfelt as only a teen can produce. They were horribly		gopher.black	70
iembarrassing and trite. I wrote six pages one night on the deep		gopher.black	70
iphilosophy behind wanting to grow out my hair, a work of literary		gopher.black	70
igenius that boiled down to the essence: "I like Highlander."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt took me a while to develop a system for using the notebooks		gopher.black	70
ithat really worked for me. In the end, my system boiled down to,		gopher.black	70
i"turn the page and write". The key to using the notebooks		gopher.black	70
ieffectively was to not have a category or a use or anything.		gopher.black	70
iI pick out one book at a time, turn the page, write whatever		gopher.black	70
iI need, then turn the next page. There is no system beyond that.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI keep all of my Moleskines. They line a shelf in my office,		gopher.black	70
imultiple rows and stacks. If you were to pick one up and thumb		gopher.black	70
ithrough it you'd find ideas for stories, notes from D&D games,		gopher.black	70
ishopping lists, phone numbers, sketches, notes from phone calls,		gopher.black	70
iand any number of other random things. This is not a problem, this		gopher.black	70
iis the heart of the notebook. It is a book for using, a book for		gopher.black	70
icapturing the moment in the written word (or drawing) and moving		gopher.black	70
ion. That's what makes it special.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhenever I doubt myself in this, I'm reminded of Leonardo Da		gopher.black	70
iVinci's notebooks. He was possibly the greatest polymath in human		gopher.black	70
ihistory and his greatest works are scribbled next to shopping		gopher.black	70
ilists. He sketched anatomy next to questions about the volume of		gopher.black	70
iwater traveling in a river. The juxtaposition came from		gopher.black	70
ia practical desire to not waste paper, and that's a bit of what		gopher.black	70
idrives my choice as well. I don't want to spend a lot of money on		gopher.black	70
ia blank book. If I do, I'll be scared to write in it for fear that		gopher.black	70
imy words won't do it justice. I'll set it aside and give it		gopher.black	70
ia grand purpose. I'll say to myself, "You can write only your		gopher.black	70
iobservations from meditation here." Or maybe, "This will be your		gopher.black	70
itravel journal on your next trip to Iceland." In the end, it will		gopher.black	70
istay on my shelf, unused. Instead, the Moleskine in my pocket will		gopher.black	70
icapture those notes along with everything else.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf the Moleskine design isn't for you, check out the US Army Green		gopher.black	70
iLogbook. They're a standard with any quatermaster and can be found		gopher.black	70
iin many places around the globe. They're cheap, plentiful, and get		gopher.black	70
ithe job done. You'll be hard pressed to find a military officer		gopher.black	70
ithat doesn't have a shelf of them at home.		gopher.black	70
