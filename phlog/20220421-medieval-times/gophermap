iYesterday was my 28th trip to Medieval Times, the dinner theater		gopher.black	70
ishow with jousting knights, falcons, horse dancing, and		gopher.black	70
icommunity-theater quality sword fights. It is one of my favorite		gopher.black	70
ithings on earth and if you haven't had the opportunity to enjoy it		gopher.black	70
ibefore, I hope you do in the future.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTickets are almost always available with some sort of discount if		gopher.black	70
iyou pop around online for a few minutes. That typically gets the		gopher.black	70
icost down to around $30-35 per person. Thus, dinner & a show for		gopher.black	70
ia reasonable rate.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAnd the dinner is quite something! You'll have fountain drinks or		gopher.black	70
itea, coffee, tomato bisque, basically a half a chicken (massive		gopher.black	70
ileg and thigh), half a baked potato, corn on the cob, and		gopher.black	70
ia dessert. There's plenty of alcohol available too, and I would		gopher.black	70
ihighly recommend it. You want as much social lubrication as you		gopher.black	70
ican get, because...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe key to medieval times is that the amount of fun you have is		gopher.black	70
idirectly proportional to the amount of energy you put in.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYour wait-staff will do their best to work a bit in-character,		gopher.black	70
icalling themselves wenches or serfs. The more veteran servers will		gopher.black	70
ieven take to the arena from time to time as squires for the		gopher.black	70
iknights. The other actors (knights, queen, chamberlain, etc) will		gopher.black	70
ibe more focused on their character portrayals and mingle with the		gopher.black	70
icrowd before the show and during it as well. Just like character		gopher.black	70
iactors at Disney World, these folks tend to have a lot of		gopher.black	70
iexperience with ad-libbing with the fans and really help to sell		gopher.black	70
ithe experience.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut even with that, and the show you're going to see, if you come		gopher.black	70
iin and passively watch without bringing your own energy to the mix		gopher.black	70
iyou're missing half the fun.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo how do you make it awesome? Well first, bring a crowd. The		gopher.black	70
ienergy in the show comes from the crowd cheering. Be boisterous.		gopher.black	70
iBe crazy. Cheer in over-the-top chants. Start a wave. Get into it!		gopher.black	70
iSure it's scripted, but so is wrestling. See how fun that can be		gopher.black	70
iwhen the crowd goes wild?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you bring a big group you can dominate the cheering for your		gopher.black	70
iknight's section and that in turn will help them get more into		gopher.black	70
itheir character. You'll attract the attention of the other actors		gopher.black	70
iand they may even riff with you. When your knight wins or falls,		gopher.black	70
ibe dramatic with them.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat else? Get the people around you into it too. This is where		gopher.black	70
ialcohol helps. Put on your extrovert face and make eye contact		gopher.black	70
iwith the kids sitting nearby. Encourage them to get up and cheer.		gopher.black	70
iThey'll see you having fun and mirror it, and it'll bring a whole		gopher.black	70
iother level of awesome to the show.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen a knight wins one of the skill contest in the first half of		gopher.black	70
ithe show they'll earn flowers they can toss to the crowd. Help		gopher.black	70
iguide their choices by having your big mass of people point toward		gopher.black	70
ithe little kids, or the old ladies. Cheer for them too.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYes, you'll be eating with your bare hands. Enjoy that! Make		gopher.black	70
ia mess. They'll give you wet-wipes later anyway. Stomp your feet,		gopher.black	70
istart a chant. Order more booze.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis is my secret sauce for a great outing and if you follow it		gopher.black	70
iI can guarantee a lot of fond memories. When I went to the show as		gopher.black	70
ia kid my dad was my role model for getting into it. As my friends		gopher.black	70
igot married over the years, we made a point of going to a Medieval		gopher.black	70
iTimes show the day after the reception as a second celebration.		gopher.black	70
iThat experience taught me the joys of cheering for the bad guy,		gopher.black	70
iand of being very drunk with friends cheering on comically bad		gopher.black	70
ifight choreography. As a dad myself, I have taken my son almost		gopher.black	70
ievery year of his life as part of our family tradition. He's		gopher.black	70
ilearning to carry the torch.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf there's a castle near you, go check it out! It's great for		gopher.black	70
ifamily reunions, birthday parties of all ages, or just a silly		gopher.black	70
isaturday night. I hope you have a great time and share your		gopher.black	70
iexperience with us here.		gopher.black	70
