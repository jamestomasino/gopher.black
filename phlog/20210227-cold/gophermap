iI've got a cold. It's just a regular one, don't worry. Even so,		gopher.black	70
iit's so frustrating. I go to few places, mix with very few people,		gopher.black	70
iwear a mask in public, wash my hands and disinfect things, and		gopher.black	70

iall the illnesses with them and I tend to get them all. Even		gopher.black	70
itaking that into account, though, they're isolated and their		gopher.black	70
ispaces are cleaned religiously. They should be a smaller vector		gopher.black	70
inow too. But my sniffly nose disagrees.		gopher.black	70

iI've started taking in-person Icelandic classes this past week.		gopher.black	70
iNo, the illness isn't from there. Nobody there is sick and we're		gopher.black	70
iall distanced and whatnot. I go back on Monday and I hope I'm		gopher.black	70
ifeeling better by then. I can't willingly bring a cold into that		gopher.black	70
iroom and I know if I start missing classes I'm not going to keep		gopher.black	70
