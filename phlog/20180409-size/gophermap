itfurrows recently wrote [0] about about the American need for more		gopher.black	70
ispace, more square footage, and generally bigger and better		gopher.black	70
ithings. You might harken it back to the "go West" mentality and an		gopher.black	70
iassumption born from multi-generational standard-of-living growth,		gopher.black	70
ibut I have no real clue where it comes from. And tfurrows is		gopher.black	70
iabsolutely right when he says you get looked at funny for defying		gopher.black	70
ithat pattern.		gopher.black	70

iMy dad certainly doesn't understand my desire to simplify,		gopher.black	70
idownsize (right-size?), and work less. It's really frustrating		gopher.black	70
iwith him in particular because he worked so hard to achieve more		gopher.black	70
iand earn more his whole life so that he could enjoy it later, but		gopher.black	70
ihe was diagnosed with a death sentence nearly the day after he		gopher.black	70
iretired. How can that not wake you up to the here and now and say,		gopher.black	70
i"use it while you've got it"?		gopher.black	70

iI want a smaller house. Much smaller. This is my first home and		gopher.black	70
iI got it for a ridiculous price because the housing market had		gopher.black	70
itanked two years before and the owner had been dropping his		gopher.black	70
iselling price ever since. It's now worth double what I paid and		gopher.black	70
iI can't wait to sell it. It's fantastic to have a bunch of space,		gopher.black	70
ibut we just fill it with things we don't have time to use. More BS		gopher.black	70
ifilling it up is no help to anyone. It's also a huge burden on us		gopher.black	70
imaintaining it and paying utilities. I don't need to work harder		gopher.black	70
iand longer to pay for things I'm not using.		gopher.black	70

iOnce we go to Iceland I plan on renting again (if their rental		gopher.black	70
isituation gets cleared up, that is) and eventually working up to		gopher.black	70
ia small home. I don't want any more space than I need. If that		gopher.black	70
imeans I have to go outside more, even better! Lowering my		gopher.black	70
icost-of-living means I can enjoy the same options or more and		gopher.black	70
istill lower my workload. I'm not going to be able to match my		gopher.black	70
icurrent salary in Iceland anyway, so it all aligns. Work less,		gopher.black	70
ilive smaller, enjoy things today instead of putting them off for		gopher.black	70
ilater.		gopher.black	70
