iLast Saturday I got off my butt and joined my local NANOWRIMO		gopher.black	70
igroup for a coffee house meetup. I had a D&D game right after that		gopher.black	70
iI needed to get to, so I only stayed for about 3 sprints, but it		gopher.black	70
iwas enough for me to dust off my Emergence story [0] and start		gopher.black	70
iback up on it. I had a decent beginning, but I really need to		gopher.black	70
iflesh out the middle and end quite a bit. 		gopher.black	70

iSo in those writing sprints, and again today, I added to the		gopher.black	70
ifourth chapter, "Secrets", giving more depth and context. It's an		gopher.black	70
iomniscient view chapter which gives it some freedom, but also		gopher.black	70
iextra pressure to make everything clear. I'm also introducing some		gopher.black	70
ipretty ethereal concepts around chaos, math, and consciousness		gopher.black	70
iwhich might lose the reader. Even so, I'm going to focus on adding		gopher.black	70
ito it first before I revise and streamline anything.		gopher.black	70

iI hope this motivation to write continues. I really like this		gopher.black	70
istory so far.		gopher.black	70
