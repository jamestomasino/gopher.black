iMy upcoming tilde server, tilde.black, is going to be focused on		gopher.black	70
iprivacy, anonymity, and security. As part of that effort the tilde		gopher.black	70
iitself is a playground for activites and code that supports those		gopher.black	70
iefforts. One example of this is connecting to the server over tor.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs described in a LifeHacker article [0]:		gopher.black	70
h[0] LifeHacker article	URL:https://lifehacker.com/what-is-tor-and-should-i-use-it-1527891029
i		gopher.black	70
i    Tor is short for The Onion Router (thus the logo) and was		gopher.black	70
i    initially a worldwide network of servers developed with the		gopher.black	70
i    U.S. Navy that enabled people to browse the internet		gopher.black	70
i    anonymously. Now, it's a non-profit organization whose main		gopher.black	70
i    purpose is the research and development of online privacy		gopher.black	70
i    tools.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    The Tor network disguises your identity by moving your traffic		gopher.black	70
i    across different Tor servers, and encrypting that traffic so		gopher.black	70
i    it isn't traced back to you. Anyone who tries would see		gopher.black	70
i    traffic coming from random nodes on the Tor network, rather		gopher.black	70
i    than your computer. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe have tor running on tilde.black and some services are offered		gopher.black	70
ithere directly as "onion services". You can browse the website by		gopher.black	70
iusing a tor browser and going to http://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion. Or		gopher.black	70
iyou can view the gopher site at gopher://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion.		gopher.black	70
iFinally, you can ssh to the machine at tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion		gopher.black	70
iinstead of tilde.black.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    (Some people may note that the web link protocol above is		gopher.black	70
i    HTTP, not HTTPS. Onion sites are already end-to-end encrypted		gopher.black	70
i    and get no benefit from HTTPS beyond publishing their		gopher.black	70
i    identity, which in many cases is contrary to the goals of		gopher.black	70
i    having an onion site. Browsing non-onion sites on tor is still		gopher.black	70
i    best done with HTTPS, though, because all traffic from an exit		gopher.black	70
i    node to that server will need some method of encryption.)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo why might we want to use tor to ssh? Anonymity of course! When		gopher.black	70
iyou log into a shared system other users can see a lot of		gopher.black	70
iinformation about you as a user. For instance, here's just the		gopher.black	70
ifirst few lines of output from the 'w' command on cosmic.voyage:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iUSER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT		gopher.black	70
itomasino pts/0    98.22.17.30-     08:27    1.00s  0.09s  0.00s tmux -u2 attach		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWell lookie there... my IP address. Depending on my threat model,		gopher.black	70
ithat may not be something I want to leave lying around everywhere		gopher.black	70
iI go since it can be traced back to me so easily. So lets look at		gopher.black	70
ione small way we can incrementally help stay anonymous.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPART ONE: tor on the server		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've covered this process in the past [1] to show how easy it is		gopher.black	70
ito set up gopher over tor. Lets review the basics again anyway.		gopher.black	70
1[1] gopher.black on tor	/phlog/20180427-gopher-black-on-tor-part-1
i		gopher.black	70
iYou'll need to:		gopher.black	70
i    - Install tor		gopher.black	70
i    - Configure tor		gopher.black	70
i    - Start tor		gopher.black	70
i    - Find your hostname		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 1: Install tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCheck out the install instructions on the tor website. In mos		gopher.black	70
icases it's as simple as:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    sudo apt install tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 2: Configure tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEverything you need to configure in tor is located at		gopher.black	70
i/etc/tor/torrc. Edit that file and search for HiddenServiceDir.		gopher.black	70
iUncomment or add lines as follows		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/		gopher.black	70
i HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe first line is where your hidden service will store all its		gopher.black	70
isecrets, like the private key it's going to auto-generate for you.		gopher.black	70
iWe'll look there in a minute to find the hostname. NOTE: the		gopher.black	70
i/hidden_service/ part of the directory path is changable. If you		gopher.black	70
iwant to run multiple different tor services by different names,		gopher.black	70
iyou can add more of these blocks and change that /hidden_service/		gopher.black	70
ito something else, like /pants/ or /web/. A cooresponding folder		gopher.black	70
iwill be created automatically when you run tor.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe HiddenServicePort line maps tor's port to your system's port.		gopher.black	70
iIf you are running ssh on port 22, this is what you'll need. NOTE:		gopher.black	70
iRunning ssh on another port does not add any tangible security,		gopher.black	70
ibut can help avoid log spam from bots that hammer at port 22.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 3: Start tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    sudo service tor start # linuxy style		gopher.black	70
i    rcctl enable tor && rcctl start tor # openbsd style		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 4: Find your hostname		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs a super-user, browse to the directory listed in		gopher.black	70
iHiddenServiceDir and you will see two files, a private key and		gopher.black	70
ia hostname. View the hostname file and you'll see your public		gopher.black	70
ionion address. Copy that for later. The private key is something		gopher.black	70
iyou may want to back up if you want to use this onion address		gopher.black	70
isafely in the future. If you lose the private key you will not be		gopher.black	70
iable to run tor at that onion address anymore. The generation of		gopher.black	70
ionion addresses can be done more creatively using tools like		gopher.black	70
iEschalot to hash millions of possible onion addresses until you		gopher.black	70
ifind a pattern that matches what you like. For instance,		gopher.black	70
itilde.black has the onion address:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPART TWO: tor on the client		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn order to ssh over tor, we'll need some way to make our terminal		gopher.black	70
isession or a terminal command run over the tor network. My		gopher.black	70
ifavorite way to do this is with a program called 'torsocks'. This		gopher.black	70
iutility pushes a single command or an entire shell through a socks		gopher.black	70
iproxy to your tor connection. Since torsocks is just a socks proxy		gopher.black	70
ithat means we'll need to do a couple things to get it to work.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou'll need to:		gopher.black	70
i    - Install tor		gopher.black	70
i    - Configure tor		gopher.black	70
i    - Install torsocks		gopher.black	70
i    - Configure torsocks		gopher.black	70
i    - Start tor & torsocks		gopher.black	70
i    - ssh		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 1: Install tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iJust like on the server you'll need to install tor on your local		gopher.black	70
imachine. Read up on the tor website to see which method works best		gopher.black	70
ifor your operating system. It's probably a one-liner.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 2: Configure tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWe need to configure our local tor differently than we did the		gopher.black	70
iserver. We don't need any hidden services this time, but we do		gopher.black	70
ineed to allow local connections to use it as a SOCKS proxy. Here's		gopher.black	70
ithe key lines you'll need to uncomment, change, or add:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    SOCKSPort 9050		gopher.black	70
i    SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16		gopher.black	70
i    SOCKSPolicy accept6 FC00::/7		gopher.black	70
i    ControlPort 9051		gopher.black	70
i    CookieAuthentication 1		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 3: Install torsocks		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    sudo apt install torsocks # linux		gopher.black	70
i    pkg_add torsocks # openbsd		gopher.black	70
i    brew install torsocks # probably works on osx?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 4: Configure torsocks		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTo be honest, I don't remember if this is required or if it comes		gopher.black	70
ilike this out of the box. Edit the file /etc/tor/torsocks.conf and		gopher.black	70
iverify that the following lines are present and not commented out:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    TorAddress 127.0.0.1		gopher.black	70
i    TorPort 9050		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 5: Start tor & torsocks		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow that everything is all configured, whenever you want to run		gopher.black	70
itorsocks you'll need to first start tor in another terminal or		gopher.black	70
itmux pane. Running tor is as easy as typing:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    $ tor		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou'll get some interesting output before it eventually says 100%		gopher.black	70
ibootstrapped. That means you're up and running. Now in your other		gopher.black	70
iterminal window you can start the torsocks proxy connection like		gopher.black	70
iso:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    $ . torsocks on		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThis will respond back with: "Tor mode activated. Every command		gopher.black	70
iwill be torified for this shell." And that's exactly it. You		gopher.black	70
ishould be fully running now and able to try your ssh connection.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStep 6: ssh		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i    $ ssh buffalo@tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion -p 1337		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA connection like above will try to connect to ssh on port 1337		gopher.black	70
iover tor using the user "buffalo". I'm using tilde.black's tor		gopher.black	70
iaddress as an example.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo give it a try and let me know it worked for you!		gopher.black	70
