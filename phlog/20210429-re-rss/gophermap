isloum just wrote about RSS [0] wondering what happend to it and		gopher.black	70
iwhy nobody links to their feeds anymore. It's a good question.		gopher.black	70
iI have an RSS feed on my blog and my labs blog, but I don't have		gopher.black	70
ia link in the webpage to them. The <link rel='alternate' is in		gopher.black	70
ithere.		gopher.black	70

iI do publish the feed links on cosmic, but that's sort of		gopher.black	70
ia byproduct of doing it on gopher where there's no link element to		gopher.black	70
ido it behind the scenes. So why don't I link to them on more		gopher.black	70
isites? I think it's partially habit. Browsers just used to expose		gopher.black	70
iRSS feeds and subscription buttons so naturally in the browser		gopher.black	70
iinterface I got used to it. When they stopped that I didn't		gopher.black	70
iretroactively promote it on my pages.		gopher.black	70

iNow that I'm thinking about it actively, that's pretty stupid. I'm		gopher.black	70
igoing to spend some time to add feed links back onto my pages		gopher.black	70
isoon. The attack on RSS/Atom has been ongoing and should be fought		gopher.black	70
ion all levels including individual action. Google Reader shutting		gopher.black	70
idown and the major browsers removing feed reading were arguably		gopher.black	70
ithe biggest blows to the standard, but the efforts haven't won out		gopher.black	70
iyet. Podcasts have a stronghold still and there are still plenty		gopher.black	70
iof readers out there. I'll do my part.		gopher.black	70
