i		gopher.black	70
iI promised that I would revisit my current bug-out bag and here		gopher.black	70
iI am to follow through. Much of this was first outlined on my web		gopher.black	70
iblog and the gear remains much the same. I've augmented some		gopher.black	70
ithings, added some new stuff, cut back on others. Let's dive in!		gopher.black	70

iSomewhere along the way I scored a free ign.com branded gym bag.		gopher.black	70
iIt's made of a heavy duty material and almost feels like a bag for		gopher.black	70
ia bowling ball. It holds everyhing on the list below (just		gopher.black	70
ibarely). There may be a time to come where I'll need to upgrade.		gopher.black	70
iI'm considering moving to a pelican case for added protection, but		gopher.black	70
iit will also add to the weight.		gopher.black	70

iWhy have one when you can have two (or 11)? I have the most		gopher.black	70
iredundency in my medical kit selection.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Swiss Safe Premium First Aid 200 Piece		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This thing has a lot of the basics: cotton swabs, bandages,		gopher.black	70
i  alcohol wipes, antiseptic wipes, sting relief pads, PVC gloves,		gopher.black	70
i  tape, moleskin, scissors, CPR facemask, a trauma pad, emergency		gopher.black	70
i  whistle, compass, sewing kit, and so on. This is a base-line for		gopher.black	70
i  first aid. It also has a little first aid guide in there, though		gopher.black	70
i  I have a better one.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Emergency First Aid - A Pocket Naturalist Guide		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This is a folded, waterproof pamphlet outlining the basics on		gopher.black	70
i  a number of first aid scenarios. Primary responses to water		gopher.black	70
i  hazards, vehicle accidents, lightning, leaking gas or smoke,		gopher.black	70
i  rescue breathing, CPR, choking, shock, eye injury, burns,		gopher.black	70
i  poisoning... you get the idea. It packs a lot of info into		gopher.black	70
i  a very small space. While I am comfortable in pretty much		gopher.black	70
i  everything on the list, my wife isn't and neither is my son. If		gopher.black	70
i  something were to happen and I were not around or incapacitated,		gopher.black	70
i  I can trust that they have access to the basic info.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- ZET Rapid Spinning Tourniquet		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I squeeze this little guy inside the Swiss Safe kit to save on		gopher.black	70
i  space. Hoping I won't need it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- MTM Survivor Dry Box with O-Ring Seal		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  My secondary and more serious medical kit all sits within the		gopher.black	70
i  nearly indestructable and completely waterproof MTM case. Pretty		gopher.black	70
i  hardcore? Not yet! Inside the MTM are three Otterbox 1000 Series		gopher.black	70
i  Waterproof Cases, also waterproof and nearly indestructable on		gopher.black	70
i  their own. It is inside these three cases that I keep the		gopher.black	70
i  contents of...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Medique 40061 First Aid Kit, 61-Piece		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Another fantastic assortment of medical thingies! Much like the		gopher.black	70
i  first list, it sports an impressive array. But it's not enough		gopher.black	70
i  on its own. Also in the MTM Dry Box with it is...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Adventure Medical Kits Trauma Packwith QuikClot		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  For everything up to and including gaping chest wounds from		gopher.black	70
i  gunshots. Nice right?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Quake Kare Emergency Thermal Blankets (4 Pack)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  A lot of serious medical injury is compounded by exposure. These		gopher.black	70
i  can help in a pinch. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Potable aqua iodine for water treatment		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I used to consider this part of the water kit, but I've		gopher.black	70
i  supplimented that elsewhere. This is more of the "oh shit" water		gopher.black	70
i  treatment, which in my head belongs in the medkit for reasons.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWere you paying attention? All that fits into two containers!		gopher.black	70

i- waterBOB Emergency Drinking Water Storage		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I love this thing. It's basically a giant, heavy-duty plastic		gopher.black	70
i  bag with some access ports and pump areas that is designed to		gopher.black	70
i  sit in your bathtub. You fill it up when the power goes out		gopher.black	70
i  before water pressure drops. It can hold over a hundred gallons,		gopher.black	70
i  which is like 375 liters or so. That's a nice backup!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Lifestraw (3 pack)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  These things are engineering miracles. The company has some		gopher.black	70
i  seriously good cred with their work in Africa too. If you're not		gopher.black	70
i  familiar with it, it's a tube about the size of a relay baton.		gopher.black	70
i  You stick one end in water--pretty much any water--and just		gopher.black	70
i  drink out of the other end. It filters amazingly well and lasts		gopher.black	70
i  over 5 years in regular use. The shelf-life is pretty much		gopher.black	70
i  forever before first use, so they're great for a bag of this		gopher.black	70
i  sort.		gopher.black	70

i- Hand Axe / Hatchet		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  If your kit needs to help you out past a day or two, being able		gopher.black	70
i  to work with the natural resources around you is imperitive.		gopher.black	70
i  Chop up some downed branches for a fire. Clear a space for your		gopher.black	70
i  family. Make some posts for hanging a trash bag (instant trash		gopher.black	70
i  bin). Be creative and live in outdoor luxury with this.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Chainmate CM-24SSP 24-Inch Survival Pocket Chain Saw With Pouch		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  If you find yourself working with tough wood that needs		gopher.black	70
i  clearing, having the right tools makes all the difference. Your		gopher.black	70
i  hatchet can do a lot, but sometimes its nice to have a saw too.		gopher.black	70
i  This thing is tiny and super light. Add it to the bag and then		gopher.black	70
i  hope you don’t need it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- ADC Medicut Shears, 7-1⁄4”		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Most scissors are weak and useless when it comes to anything		gopher.black	70
i  other than wrapping paper. These things have some real power,		gopher.black	70
i  and they’ll get the job done again and again. You can even		gopher.black	70
i  sharpen them! I'd put this on the medical list, but their		gopher.black	70
i  utility goes way beyond that. Besides, I have a dedicated		gopher.black	70
i  medical set inside the waterproof box that I didn't even mention		gopher.black	70
i  because they're so small and insignificant. There's tongue		gopher.black	70
i  depressors in there too. You don't need to know everything!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Entrenching Tool		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  My advice for survival scenarios: Learn how to make a latrine.		gopher.black	70
i  Seriously. It’ll take you five minutes to watch a video on		gopher.black	70
i  youtube and it will make your outdoor living much, much easier.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Folding Camp Saw  		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Another backup for your chainsaw. Or maybe the chainsaw is the		gopher.black	70
i  backup. If you’re going to stay outdoors for any length of time,		gopher.black	70
i  bring a saw.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Mora Sweden Classic #1 Red Wood Handle Carbon Steel Knife		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Very few knives are better than this one. At 15$, you can afford		gopher.black	70
i  to get extras too. Treat them well: sharpened, oiled, not		gopher.black	70
i  chipped. They’ll last a lifetime.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
i  This thing is a beast. I charged it with the hand crank for just		gopher.black	70
i  over ten seconds and then sat listening to the radio all day		gopher.black	70
i  long. If you plan on staying in touch with the outside world (or		gopher.black	70
i  at least informed), having a backup radio with NOAA stations is		gopher.black	70
i  important. Besides, this little guy will charge your cellphone		gopher.black	70
i  too! 		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i- Petzl E97 Tikka Plus 2 Headlamp		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  In the redundency department, along with your knives, add light		gopher.black	70
i  to the list. A headlamp will keep your hands free to do work.		gopher.black	70
i  They last a really long time with LEDs.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Gerber Infinity Ultra Task Light		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Bring a flashlight, but not one with huge, honkin’ D batteries.		gopher.black	70
i  They’re harder to find replacements than AA, and much heavier.		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
i  I’m an Eagle Scout, and thus I never feel lost if I have a good		gopher.black	70
i  length of rope. Paracord is extremely strong for its size, but		gopher.black	70
i  it packs down light and tight. Use it for everything and		gopher.black	70
i  everything from a clothesline to animal traps in the worst of		gopher.black	70
i  situations. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Other Paracord		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I got a handful of free paracord bracelets at some festival and		gopher.black	70

i  		gopher.black	70
i- Size #36 Dyed Black & Tarred Twine, 1lb		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This is work-horse line. The other stuff is special and high		gopher.black	70
i  quality. When you just need to tie something up, this is what		gopher.black	70
i  you use. It lasts well with a tensile strength of 320lbs.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- 3M Scotch Heavy Duty All-Weather Duct Tape		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Don’t settle for the cheap duct tape. Get the good outdoor		gopher.black	70
i  all-weather stuff. One roll should be more than enough to patch		gopher.black	70
i  things up, bandage you up, make a stretcher, or any number of		gopher.black	70
i  other tasks. 		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i- Smith’s PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  A dull knife is almost as bad as no knife. If you’re going to be		gopher.black	70
i  using them… really using them, keep them sharp. This will also		gopher.black	70
i  help you in cases of accidental cuts. A clean cut heals much		gopher.black	70
i  faster and with less chance of infection.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Youngstown Glove General Utility Lined with KEVLAR Glove		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The most common place to injure yourself working in survival		gopher.black	70
i  situations is on your hands. Protect them with more than a pair		gopher.black	70
i  of designer cotton gloves. These guys have Kevlar on the insides		gopher.black	70
i  and outsides of your hands. Fantastic, and worth the price. Test		gopher.black	70
i  them out with some yard work and you’ll see what I mean.		gopher.black	70

i- Improvised Trapping - Pathfinder Outdoor Survival Guide		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Another waterproof pamphlet that outlines how to build snares		gopher.black	70
i  and deadfall traps, how to gut & clean small game and fish, and		gopher.black	70
i  other necessary info for basic food prep. It even shows how to		gopher.black	70
i  dry meat for long-term storage. I love these guides. There's one		gopher.black	70
i  on Mushrooms that I'm eyeing up.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Spectra® Braided Cord 1050lb test - Heavy Duty Speargun Line		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This cord is great for any number of uses, but it is in the kit		gopher.black	70
i  especially for hanging a bear-bag. I use the PCT method myself,		gopher.black	70
i  so I have the tools to fit it. In a pinch, though, you can get		gopher.black	70
i  away with just a bag and line. Wildlife have incredible senses		gopher.black	70
i  of smells. Remember, if you are outside, you don’t have walls		gopher.black	70
i  keeping your food and gear safe. Be wary and hang your food.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This line is also great for setting snares and traps. It's		gopher.black	70
i  extremely thin & strong, a great combo.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Stuff Sacks (Bear Bag, etc)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  To go along with the line above, these stuff sacks from zpacks		gopher.black	70
i  are wonderful. They weigh almost nothing and are very sturdy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Solo Stove		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This little wood burner is a beast. Go check out a youtube video		gopher.black	70
i  or something. They're amazing and cheap for what they offer.		gopher.black	70
i  I hate holding on to gas. It's dangerous and hard to get more.		gopher.black	70
i  Wood is plentiful.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Some other generic metal frame stove thing		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I'm not sure where I got it, but it's two half-round pieces of		gopher.black	70
i  metal that intersect and form a platform to hold a pot. You		gopher.black	70
i  build a fire in it or drop some embers in there and you're set.		gopher.black	70
i  I don't use it that way most of the time. Instead, I use it as		gopher.black	70
i  a wind-screen for the solo stove. It's wide enough to encircle		gopher.black	70
i  the whole thing. Neat, right?		gopher.black	70

iAll of the things mentioned live in that ign.com gym bag, as		gopher.black	70

iIn an immediate emergency that is indeed what I grab and take out		gopher.black	70
ithe door. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn fact, a few months ago our Carbon Monoxide alarm sounded at two		gopher.black	70
iin the morning. We jumped out of bed, grabbed the kid, grabbed the		gopher.black	70
ibag and went out to the car. I called emergency services from		gopher.black	70
ithere and they came and cleared the house. (Note: carbon monoxide		gopher.black	70
idetectors accumulate CO over time, weakening their ability to		gopher.black	70
iidentify a "spike" in the gas. It's important to replace them		gopher.black	70
ievery few years.)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn addition to the bag I grabbed, I also have a toolbag in the		gopher.black	70
iback of my car that's always present. It has some extra helpful		gopher.black	70
itools, camping gear, etc. I keep it all in a well-waxed canvas		gopher.black	70
ibag. There's more rope, another wood-fire stove, blades, saws,		gopher.black	70
icar-tools, and so on. If it weren't late and if I were wearing		gopher.black	70
ipants I'd go grab the bag and do an inventory here. I also keep		gopher.black	70
itwo fleece blankets and a fantastic quality 100% wool blanket from		gopher.black	70
iHudson Bay Company in the back of the car. Exposure kills.		gopher.black	70

i  Sleeping on the ground can be rough. Go easy on your back with		gopher.black	70
i  a little layer. More importantly, get some insulation between		gopher.black	70
i  your body and the ground. The earth will suck the heat right out		gopher.black	70
i  of you.		gopher.black	70

i- Snow Peak Ti-Mini Solo Combo Cook Set		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Have something to heat up water. In survival situations, many		gopher.black	70
i  times “cooking” literally means, “add hot water”. Heat to		gopher.black	70
i  purify. Heat to rehydrate. Heat!		gopher.black	70

i- Snow Peak Ti-Double H600 Stacking Mug		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This mug stacks nicely with the cookset above, so I have a pot		gopher.black	70
i  for heating the water, and a cup for eating. It keeps my cooking		gopher.black	70
i  pot clean.		gopher.black	70

i- Bibler Tempest Tent (4-season)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  There’s a lot of ways to make a shelter outdoors. This is		gopher.black	70
i  a pretty hardcore 4-season lightweight tent. It’s not the		gopher.black	70
i  cheapest solution, nor the best in all situations. I use it for		gopher.black	70
i  a variety of camping conditions outside of my emergency kit. If		gopher.black	70
i  you aren’t much of an outdoorsman, there’s probably a better		gopher.black	70
i  shelter for you. Ask around at Gander Mtn or REI, or bug your		gopher.black	70
i  local scouts when they try to sell you popcorn.		gopher.black	70

i- Gossamer Gear Mariposa Ultralight Backpack		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I adore this bag. It's so light weight it feels like nothing at		gopher.black	70
i  all. The padding and supports are great and it has a huge number		gopher.black	70
i  of ways to distribute weight. Just brilliant.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThere's other stuff in there too. I line the inside of my bag with		gopher.black	70
iplastic to isolate dry stuff from wet. There's some other		gopher.black	70
ifancy-schmancy gear I could go into, but it's all meant for		gopher.black	70
icamping, not survival. Still, I wanted to mention that I have it		gopher.black	70
iaround. If the emergency provides a bit more planning all of that		gopher.black	70
igets bundled up too. If we will take the car, then the cast iron		gopher.black	70
istuff is coming with me, especially the dutch oven. If we're		gopher.black	70
irunning from zombies, I'll probably leave the weight behind.		gopher.black	70

istuff. Regardless, it's a nice reference to have out there in		gopher.black	70
