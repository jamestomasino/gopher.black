iIt's been a while since my last phlog*. I've been wanting to get		gopher.black	70
iback on gopher and do some serious plain text awesomeness, or at		gopher.black	70
ileast comment on the really cool happenings around the space. Cat,		gopher.black	70
ilove your diet, tell me more! How are you and your partner going		gopher.black	70
ito handle it when you go back down under? Sparkipx, how's Felix		gopher.black	70
iholding up now that you've been able to ride for a couple weeks?		gopher.black	70
iIs it harder to do long distances on a folding bike than		gopher.black	70
ia non-folding one? I've never tried one before. jynx, I'm totally		gopher.black	70
ifascinated by single player RPGs and I need to go back through and		gopher.black	70
iread up on your stuff. Tabletop role-playing is my #1 activity of		gopher.black	70
iawesome, and that sounds stellar. horsemans has a cool gopher		gopher.black	70
iwishlist that you guys should check out. I bet you can offer a lot		gopher.black	70

iSeveral of you are on vacation or soon returning. Welcome back and		gopher.black	70
iall that. I hope you'll share insights and adventures. I love		gopher.black	70
itravel stories so much. Hell, I love STORIES so much. tfurrows,		gopher.black	70
iI'll be checking out Variations soon! Oh, and I have a Fiskers		gopher.black	70
ipush-mower and it's badass. I have to use it twice a week or the		gopher.black	70
igrass grows too long for it to be effective. That part sucks. But		gopher.black	70
iif you have a really small lawn, it's so nice to be able to handle		gopher.black	70
iit quietly and "naturally".		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iRecently I've been absorbed in a string of poor projects at work		gopher.black	70
ithat have been eating up my mental energies. The work isn't hard,		gopher.black	70
ibut the clients have been difficult. I've been avoiding		gopher.black	70
iunnecessary computer time as a way of disconnecting. Marry that up		gopher.black	70
iwith some unexpected (but welcome) consulting work, and my time		gopher.black	70
ibecame even more short. Mostly, though, the thing that's kept me		gopher.black	70
iaway is a rededication to that principle I mentioned in recent		gopher.black	70
iposts, deliberate practice.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've been working on my shakuhachi quite a bit, and even met with		gopher.black	70
imy kali instructor in the park at the side of a lake for		gopher.black	70
ia fantastic jam in the rain. He built me a new shakuhachi, which		gopher.black	70
iis just fantastic. It's a 1.9 (slightly deeper sound than the		gopher.black	70
istandard 1.8) jin nashi flute and it's absolutely perfect. I'll be		gopher.black	70
isewing a new case for it soon, and an extra for him as well in		gopher.black	70
ithanks.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've also been walking a shit-ton. Every morning I wake at 6:35		gopher.black	70
iand head outside to walk 2 to 2.5 miles on the canal towpath that		gopher.black	70
iis the road I live on. Each evening, after putting my son to bed,		gopher.black	70
iI head back outside and do another 2 miles. Sometimes I zip around		gopher.black	70
ithe neighborhood for a change of scenery. Sometimes I head into		gopher.black	70
itown and walk the sidewalks. Most often I stay next to the canal		gopher.black	70
iwhere I know the landscape features that mark my distance by		gopher.black	70
iheart. I pop headphones in and binge audiobooks while I'm out		gopher.black	70
ithere. It's heaven.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWalking is a "keystone habit" for me, a term I learned from that		gopher.black	70
ibook on Habits with the yellow cover that I can't remember the		gopher.black	70
iname of. When I walk, I do other good things as well. I eat well,		gopher.black	70
iI sleep well, I think clearly. If I don't walk, holding on to the		gopher.black	70
iother things is more difficult. So, walking rocks!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHopefully I'll have more to share soon. In the meantime, I need to		gopher.black	70
igo for a walk.		gopher.black	70

i------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i* I have a pet peeve about when people waste time in blogs and		gopher.black	70
iphlogs talking about how they haven't posted in a long time.		gopher.black	70
iThat's the nature of the medium and the repetitive act of		gopher.black	70
iexplaining or apologizing for it serves no purpose except to make		gopher.black	70
iyou self-conscious. Now here I am doing it myself. Stupid.		gopher.black	70
