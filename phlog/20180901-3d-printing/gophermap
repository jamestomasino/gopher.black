iI bought a 3D printer. It's a FlashForge Finder, available on		gopher.black	70
iAmazon for somewhere in the $300-350USD range at present. It		gopher.black	70
iprints PLA but not ABS, has a decent sized print area, comes fully		gopher.black	70
iassembled, and has fair community support. The service that		gopher.black	70
iFlashForge offers is extremely responsive and helpful. Overall I'm		gopher.black	70
iquite pleased with the purchase.		gopher.black	70

iSince Tuesday I've been printing things almost non-stop. I've made		gopher.black	70
ian external spool holder to support bigger filament spools than		gopher.black	70
ithe printer can handle normally. I've got a tool holder caddy on		gopher.black	70
ithe box as well. I've made an Arduino Uno bumper/baseplate, a few		gopher.black	70
itoys for my son including squishy turtles and a fully articulated		gopher.black	70
isnail with shell that opens. As I'm writing this a book holder		gopher.black	70
ijust finished.		gopher.black	70

iI'll be making some desk accessories soon, and then I think I'll		gopher.black	70
itake my first stab at designing my own piece by modifying the		gopher.black	70
ihanging tool-holder to make a glue-stick holder of the same style.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3D printing is pretty fantastic. It's really easy, way faster than		gopher.black	70
iI expected, and the quality of this personally affordable model is		gopher.black	70
isuprisingly good. I can make real things!		gopher.black	70

iOh, I made a few rings for my wife. She's allergic to metal, so		gopher.black	70
ithis is perfect. I've sanded them down and I'm priming them now.		gopher.black	70
iLater today I'll paint and seal them for her. Isn't that exciting?		gopher.black	70
iI can design her jewelry, print it, post-process, and she can wear		gopher.black	70
iit all in the same day. That's some agrestic shit right there [0].		gopher.black	70
