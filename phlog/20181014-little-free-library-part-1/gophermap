iBelow is a list of notes I've prepared while building my little		gopher.black	70
ifree ebook library. What is that, you ask? Well, it's a solar		gopher.black	70
ipowered rapsberry pi zero w that will live off-grid with an open		gopher.black	70
iwifi access point. When a user connects to it, Captive Portal will		gopher.black	70
iautomatically trigger a "sign-in" page. The page isn't meant to		gopher.black	70
isign into anything, though. Instead it will present users with		gopher.black	70
ifree ebooks for download to their devices! 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy first go will likely be a collection of PDF maps from USGS,		gopher.black	70
isome trail guides and bird identification things that are		gopher.black	70
iappropriate for the trail that runs past my house.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy TODO list remains:		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i  - Test apple devices captive portal		gopher.black	70
i  - Design a static site page to download the ebooks		gopher.black	70
