iSomeone recently asked for advice on developing patience. I'm		gopher.black	70
ifairly certain it was jynx (edit: link [0]), but his phlog is down		gopher.black	70
iat the moment. Regardless, I've got some practice in that area and		gopher.black	70
ibelieve I can offer some advice.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i1. Treat patience like a skill to be developed. That means you		gopher.black	70
i   need to practice it. It doesn't mean you need to dive into the		gopher.black	70
i   deep end right away (to mix metaphors). There's books on the		gopher.black	70
i   topic as it relates to will power, but this is the key concept		gopher.black	70
i   at the heart of all of them. "Will power (or patience) is like		gopher.black	70
i   a muscle (or skill), so exercise it (or practice it).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i   Specifically: Buy a Kendama game [1]. Do not just start using		gopher.black	70
i   it blindly, though. Watch a couple youtube videos to get the		gopher.black	70
i   idea, then practice it. I recommend practicing it with your		gopher.black	70
i   off-hand and set goals that are a little bit frustrating, but		gopher.black	70
i   not impossible. "I will not stop using this until I can		gopher.black	70
i   complete this challenge at least 5 times in a row." Do not		gopher.black	70
i   succumb to your frustration. Push it that little extra.		gopher.black	70

i2. Meditate. Give your mind some time to relax and clean itself		gopher.black	70
i   up. The type of meditation isn't actually that important, it's		gopher.black	70
i   the practice of deliberate thinking that will help. Still,		gopher.black	70
i   don't choose something frustrating here. This is your mental		gopher.black	70
i   rest equivalent of the patience exercsises above. Just set		gopher.black	70
i   a timer for 5-10 minutes, sit down and let your mind wander. If		gopher.black	70
i   find you are focusing in on any one thing for more than		gopher.black	70
i   a moment, gently remind yourself that you can come back to it		gopher.black	70
i   after the timer goes off. Reset yourself by clearing out the		gopher.black	70
i   brain completely for a brief moment. Here's a trick to make		gopher.black	70
i   that happen super fast: Think to yourself, "what will my next		gopher.black	70
i   thought be?"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i3. Do not expect infinite patience. You're not super-human, so		gopher.black	70
i   don't be hard on yourself if you reach your end. Try to hang on		gopher.black	70
i   a bit longer and go away from the situation if you can. Don't		gopher.black	70
i   beat yourself up. That will make it harder to get better.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i4. Vent. Whatever technique you have to blow off steam, use it.		gopher.black	70
i   Using yet another metaphor, think of patience like a big empty		gopher.black	70
i   tank inside you that can swallow the frustrations of the day.		gopher.black	70
i   You could keep building a bigger and bigger tank, or you can		gopher.black	70
i   drain it. Resting does that, but so can venting. Blow off		gopher.black	70
i   that frustration steam and make your job easier. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iGood luck, person who I am pretty sure is jynx.		gopher.black	70
