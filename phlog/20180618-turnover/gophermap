i		gopher.black	70
iI'm losing one of the developers on my team. He's decided to move		gopher.black	70
ion to another job. He's a really solid programmer and a nice guy		gopher.black	70
iand it's a shame to lose him.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI knew he was in a position to be looking and I tried to warn the		gopher.black	70
imanagement team about it. Unfortunately, the types of things he		gopher.black	70
ineeded to stay weren't thing I could offer. It happens sometimes.		gopher.black	70
iI hope to get a chance to spend a bit of exit-interview time with		gopher.black	70
ihim and get some feedback on my own management style. Maybe		gopher.black	70
ithere's something to be learned.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm not sure if he ever reads my gopher content (though I am sure		gopher.black	70
ihe knows about it). If so, I'm sad to see you go, but wish you the		gopher.black	70
ibest of luck at the new gig.		gopher.black	70
