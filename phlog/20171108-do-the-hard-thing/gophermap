 Do the Hard Thing

 I've been thinking about lessons that I want to teach my boy.
 Boiling down all my experiences and knowledge to some core
 principles that I can invest him with to help him in the future is
 both thrilling and overwhelming. On the one hand, I have a lot of
 specific things I've experienced I could steer him on, but I think
 it will be difficult to make all the individual stuff stick with
 him. Instead I think it would be best to focus on principles, like
 living a life with the willingness to say "Yes!" to new
 opportunites and challenges. That's what led me to the Navy, or to
 the Jesuits, or to live in Alaska. I think it's an important and
 generally helpful attitude to pass on. 
 
 Most recently I was thinking about an idea I learned as a Jesuit
 novice called "agere contra". It means to do the opposite. In the
 context of Ignatian spirituality it is making a reference to the
 types of comfort we experience by doing what comes easy and
 natural to us. St. Ignatius thought that by avoiding these natural
 trappings of "easy" we would be forced to rely on God as we faced
 the unknown scary things and in doing so become closer with Him.
 
 As an example, when I started the novitiate, all of the novices
 were taken around the city to the various apostolates where we
 would be spending our "working" time during formation. There were
 hospitals, nursing homes, hospice care, schools, food pantries,
 and other various charities and social services. Our novice
 director told us to thing about the different places as we
 explored them and to pray on each of them and imagine ourselves
 working there. Only after we had done that did they introduce the
 concept of agere contra. The director said, list for me the top
 two apostolates which are the most intimidating to you, the
 scariest, or the most unnatural to your experience and
 disposition. What are the last choices you would make. And with
 that in mind, he helped assign us to something hard.
 
 In my case that meant I worked in hospice care and elementary
 education, both of which seemed terrifying. I went on to
 experience some of the most rewarding months of my life. I not
 only broadened my exposure to new things, but I also gained
 confidence in my ability (with God's help) to take on the unknown
 and not just survive, but to thrive.
 
 In the case of my son, the idea of agere contra might be a little
 bit too complex. Maybe it takes a more sophisticated understanding
 of the world and yourself to put it into action. But there are
 parts I think he can grok even at 5 years old.
 
 Do the hard thing.
 
 That's the heart I'm working on with him now. I think there's more
 in that idea than just agere contra, too. As we face increasing
 threats to employment through automation, focusing on doing and
 learning what is hard is a generally safe way of proceeding. In
 working in a group, taking on the hard part will instill a valued
 social skill. Ethically it conditions him to avoid poor choices
 through laziness. There's so much good that comes from choosing
 the hard path.
 
 Turning that lesson inward, I stare at my list of hobbies and
 cringe. I flounder and fail to progress because I am lazy and do
 whichever thing strikes my fancy. I need to be deliberate in my
 practice or study. I need to do the hard things. Lets see what
 I can do with that principle and some motivation.
