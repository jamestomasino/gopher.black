iWow, so that was a big change. I was annoyed with some of my code		gopher.black	70
iin burrow so I did a bit of surgery and blew up some features and		gopher.black	70
imade some more generalized helpers instead.		gopher.black	70

iGONE!		gopher.black	70

iburrow edit-config will generate a new config for you if you don't		gopher.black	70
ialready have one. I've also added a new super-powerful command		gopher.black	70
icalled:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iburrow gophermap		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEnter that and hit enter and it'll open your root gophermap. But		gopher.black	70
ithat's not all!!! Hit tab after that bad-boy...		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iburrow gophermap <tab>		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt'll list all your directories and any gophermaps you've got. You		gopher.black	70
ican crawl your way through with more tab completion. You don't		gopher.black	70
ineed to be in your gopher directory for it either. It'll figure it		gopher.black	70
iall out! :D		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOnce you hit enter it'll strip out "i" types and tabs and server		gopher.black	70
iinfo from your gophermap temporarily so you can edit it. Once you		gopher.black	70
isave it again it'll add all the fancy codes back in place. Open up		gopher.black	70
ia new filename that you make up on the spot to create a new		gopher.black	70
igophermap. It'll default to no title, but you can fill in that		gopher.black	70
