icmus and vim updates

iI have been avoiding using cmus for years because of the stupidest
ireason. I didn't know how to sort the sorted library view into
ialbum view. My collection is 100% full albums, and that's how
iI prefer to listen to music, so this was really annoying. I could
iuse the main library view and expand individual artists to get to
itheir albums, but it didn't feel right. After looking all around
ithe web and finding nada, I stumbled on screen 7 (settings) and
ifound the key myself... (A)!
i
iNow cmus is a dream and I'm in album-y bliss. We do the stupidest
ithings, don't we? That reminds me that I should really get back
iaround to using mutt instead of Alpine.
i
iOver in vim world, I did a major restructure of my dotfiles by
irecombining all the various parts into a single .vimrc file. I had
ibroken out things like bundles and mappings and autocommands into
iseparate files to keep things organized. Now that I really grok
iwhat's going on in my config it felt bloated. I stripped out a ton
iof code and plugins and replaced things with simpler settings. No
imore Airline or Eleline, just plain old statusline. I annotated
iall my bundles as well so I know at a glance what each is there
ifor. That was a problem in the past (not a good sign).
i
iI dropped the solarized theme from my shell as well and got some
isane colors. Things are crisp and clear again.
i
iFinally, I grabbed dbucklin's timestamp mapping from his recent
iphlog entry [0]. It's super cool and I can't wait to use it.
