 cmus and vim updates
 November 12th, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 I have been avoiding using cmus for years because of the stupidest
 reason. I didn't know how to sort the sorted library view into
 album view. My collection is 100% full albums, and that's how
 I prefer to listen to music, so this was really annoying. I could
 use the main library view and expand individual artists to get to
 their albums, but it didn't feel right. After looking all around
 the web and finding nada, I stumbled on screen 7 (settings) and
 found the key myself... (A)!
 
 Now cmus is a dream and I'm in album-y bliss. We do the stupidest
 things, don't we? That reminds me that I should really get back
 around to using mutt instead of Alpine.
 
 Over in vim world, I did a major restructure of my dotfiles by
 recombining all the various parts into a single .vimrc file. I had
 broken out things like bundles and mappings and autocommands into
 separate files to keep things organized. Now that I really grok
 what's going on in my config it felt bloated. I stripped out a ton
 of code and plugins and replaced things with simpler settings. No
 more Airline or Eleline, just plain old statusline. I annotated
 all my bundles as well so I know at a glance what each is there
 for. That was a problem in the past (not a good sign).
 
 I dropped the solarized theme from my shell as well and got some
 sane colors. Things are crisp and clear again.
 
 Finally, I grabbed dbucklin's timestamp mapping from his recent
 phlog entry [0]. It's super cool and I can't wait to use it.
