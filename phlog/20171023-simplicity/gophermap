 Simplicity
 October 23rd, 2017
 ----------------------------------------
 
 There's been quite a bit of discussion on asceticism or
 technological simplification as an approach to generally
 simplified living happening on Gopher lately [0,1,2,3,4]. So much
 has been said and I'm late to the party, as it were.
 
 First of all, I love technology. I am a collector of archaic tech
 in particular: abacus, sextant, slide-rule, spinning wheel, etc.
 On the other hand, I would rather do without many of the more
 recent technical innovations. I don't have a firm definition for
 where I draw the line. Instead, I rely on my experience and
 emotional response. Does this device make me feel more empowered
 or is it "doing it for me" to such a degree that I'm crippled
 without it? Does the device make me feel more connected or does it
 give the impression of connection while actually distancing?
 
 I am a backpacking, camping, casual-prepping, dutch-oven-cooking,
 yarn spinning, flute carving, boardgame playing, outdoorsy tech
 guy. I daydream about apocalyptic scenarios where my hobby
 interests would suddenly become my focus. I appreciate what
 a giant, sprawling information network does for humanity, but
 I still prefer cabin life like many of you. 
 
 At its core I'm expressing an emotional preference with a bit of
 spiritual guidance. I also fully understand that my daydreams of
 a Walden lifestyle would come with a heavy price. Reality as it
 is, I still don't see any problem living with that floating desire
 driving my actions and interests. Even if I am never accidentally
 transported back in time a hundred years I can still find great
 enjoyment in the thought.
 
 I really appreciate this gopher exchange. I hope we see more
 threads like this evolve over time.
