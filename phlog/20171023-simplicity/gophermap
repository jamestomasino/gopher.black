iThere's been quite a bit of discussion on asceticism or
itechnological simplification as an approach to generally
isimplified living happening on Gopher lately [0,1,2,3,4]. So much
ihas been said and I'm late to the party, as it were.
i
iFirst of all, I love technology. I am a collector of archaic tech
iin particular: abacus, sextant, slide-rule, spinning wheel, etc.
iOn the other hand, I would rather do without many of the more
irecent technical innovations. I don't have a firm definition for
iwhere I draw the line. Instead, I rely on my experience and
iemotional response. Does this device make me feel more empowered
ior is it "doing it for me" to such a degree that I'm crippled
iwithout it? Does the device make me feel more connected or does it
igive the impression of connection while actually distancing?
i
iI am a backpacking, camping, casual-prepping, dutch-oven-cooking,
iyarn spinning, flute carving, boardgame playing, outdoorsy tech
iguy. I daydream about apocalyptic scenarios where my hobby
iinterests would suddenly become my focus. I appreciate what
ia giant, sprawling information network does for humanity, but
iI still prefer cabin life like many of you. 
i
iAt its core I'm expressing an emotional preference with a bit of
ispiritual guidance. I also fully understand that my daydreams of
ia Walden lifestyle would come with a heavy price. Reality as it
iis, I still don't see any problem living with that floating desire
idriving my actions and interests. Even if I am never accidentally
itransported back in time a hundred years I can still find great
ienjoyment in the thought.
i
iI really appreciate this gopher exchange. I hope we see more
ithreads like this evolve over time.
