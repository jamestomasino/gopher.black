 When it comes to writing gopher entries on a mobile device, is
 there really anything better than vim? Of course not! It's
 optimized for slow, wonky connections where every keypress
 matters. It gives me a smile everytime I get to use it this way.
 
 I had jynx phlog in moku-pona at the wrong address (added a /phlog
 that wasn't necessary) so I moshed in to fix it. 8 characters
 typed and it was fixed and saved. Happy times.
