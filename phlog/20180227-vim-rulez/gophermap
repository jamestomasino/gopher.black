iWhen it comes to writing gopher entries on a mobile device, is
ithere really anything better than vim? Of course not! It's
ioptimized for slow, wonky connections where every keypress
imatters. It gives me a smile everytime I get to use it this way.

iI had jynx phlog in moku-pona at the wrong address (added a /phlog
ithat wasn't necessary) so I moshed in to fix it. 8 characters
ityped and it was fixed and saved. Happy times.
