iA few folks were kind enough to let me know that my recent		gopher.black	70
iexperiments with tor [0][1] broke my gopher hole mirrored on SDF		gopher.black	70
iand tilde.town. In reality, those mirrors weren't all that useful		gopher.black	70
iin the first place. All the links in my gophermaps to internal		gopher.black	70
iresources were using full, complete hostnames & ports. Thus, if		gopher.black	70
iyou went to SDF, after link #1 you were really over on		gopher.black	70
igopher.black anyway.		gopher.black	70

1[1] gopher.black on tor, part 2	/phlog/20180428-gopher-black-on-tor-part-2
i		gopher.black	70
iThis wasn't ideal, but it was low priority. It worked well enough,		gopher.black	70
iright? When I removed the explicit hostname & port info from		gopher.black	70
igophermaps to allow my dual server goodness for tor, suddenly SDF		gopher.black	70
iand tilde.town thought that my links were legitimately local.		gopher.black	70
iThere was just one problem... my content paths are different on		gopher.black	70
iall three systems.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOn gopher.black, / is mine. Everything starts there.		gopher.black	70
iOn SDF, /users/tomasino is mine.		gopher.black	70
iOn tilde.town, /~tomasino is mine		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe fix didn't take a ton of work since I already had a pretty		gopher.black	70
isolid foundation for mirroring the content. I have a local copy of		gopher.black	70
imy gopher git repo on those boxes and a cron-job that pulls it		gopher.black	70
ifour times a day. Simple! Well, now I have a little extra goodness		gopher.black	70
iin there.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe update process looks like so:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - Fetch the remote		gopher.black	70
i  - Check the SHA of the latest commit in HEAD vs origin/master		gopher.black	70
i  - If different:		gopher.black	70
i    - force reset the local head		gopher.black	70
i    - pull origin/master		gopher.black	70
i    - find all gophermaps and use sed to replace root paths		gopher.black	70
i    - touch the local folder (for SDF's phlog list)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iHere's the code [2]:		gopher.black	70

i		gopher.black	70
iIt's not the cleanest. I could remove the pushd/popd stuff. It's		gopher.black	70
ilegacy from a much more complex process time. The sed command is		gopher.black	70
icumbersome as well. I could have matched \t/[^\t]*$ instead, but		gopher.black	70
iit works. So, like most of my stuff... good enough.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iA final note:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMoku Pona & my reading lists are local cron tasks on gopher.black		gopher.black	70
ithat update quite often. To avoid a bajillion commits to my gopher		gopher.black	70
irepo I don't include them at all. That means my moku-pona list and		gopher.black	70
ireading lists are not available on SDF or tilde.town. All the rest		gopher.black	70
iof the goods are there, though.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iEnjoy & stuff!		gopher.black	70
