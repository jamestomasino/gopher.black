 Resolution
 January 01st, 2018
 ----------------------------------------
 
 A brand new year, like a brand new day, brings opportunity for
 change. There's plenty I'd like to change.
 
 I want something different this time. I want time to belong to me
 rather than be its slave.
 
 The computer in my office is the first culprit. I settle in at my
 desk in the evening and find infinite ways to occupy myself. At
 the end of the night I go to bed dissatisfied with my choices. Why
 didn't I spend that time practicing my music, or using my spinning
 wheel?
 
 Should I avoid computers in the evening? That sounds like
 a blanket resolution that is easy to recite and impossible to
 fulfill. Beside which, the computer isn't the problem. It is
 a symptom of a problem I have. 
 
 My resolution for 2018 is to use the time I have available doing
 the things that interest me and to avoid the traps of laziness.
