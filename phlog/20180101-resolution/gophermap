iResolution
iJanuary 01st, 2018
i----------------------------------------
i
iA brand new year, like a brand new day, brings opportunity for
ichange. There's plenty I'd like to change.
i
iI want something different this time. I want time to belong to me
irather than be its slave.
i
iThe computer in my office is the first culprit. I settle in at my
idesk in the evening and find infinite ways to occupy myself. At
ithe end of the night I go to bed dissatisfied with my choices. Why
ididn't I spend that time practicing my music, or using my spinning
iwheel?
i
iShould I avoid computers in the evening? That sounds like
ia blanket resolution that is easy to recite and impossible to
ifulfill. Beside which, the computer isn't the problem. It is
ia symptom of a problem I have. 
i
iMy resolution for 2018 is to use the time I have available doing
ithe things that interest me and to avoid the traps of laziness.
