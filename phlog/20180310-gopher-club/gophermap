iStrange things afoot in the 1436. Gophernicus no longer rules the
iday, at least under the gopher.club name. Some familiar tricks
ilike the = cgi are gone and some of our favorite burrows are gone
ito ground, as it were, until the dust settles. What doth our
ioverlord have in mind? Only time will tell.
i
iIn the meantime harken over to christyotwisty's fancy new digs [0]
iand feast your eyes upon her fabulous ascii art banner. Well done!
