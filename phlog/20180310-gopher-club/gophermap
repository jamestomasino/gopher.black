 Strange things afoot in the 1436. Gophernicus no longer rules the
 day, at least under the gopher.club name. Some familiar tricks
 like the = cgi are gone and some of our favorite burrows are gone
 to ground, as it were, until the dust settles. What doth our
 overlord have in mind? Only time will tell.
 
 In the meantime harken over to christyotwisty's fancy new digs [0]
 and feast your eyes upon her fabulous ascii art banner. Well done!
