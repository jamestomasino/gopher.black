 Storymatic

 I picked up The Storymatic [0] at a toy store in Princeton today.
 It's a box of cards that are used as writing prompts. The
 instructions say to draw two of the gold character cards and one
 of the bronze lead-in cards. The two character cards together form
 a main character and the lead-in gets the story moving. Beyond
 that there are only two rules:
 
   1. The character must change in some way during the story. 
   2. You cannot kill the main character 
 
 It's a very simple system. I'm tempted to do a little data-entry
 and digitize the whole thing into a shell script. I just may do
 that one night, but I'll fight the urge tonight. Instead tonight
 will be spent actually using The Storymatic for its intended
 purpose. I'll be creating a new section for writing exercsises [1]
 over in the Writing [2] section. If you're a fast gopher reader
 that content might not be live yet, so come back in an hour or two
 and try again.
 
 I have a passion for writing but I don't spend the time to develop
 my craft. There's no excuse for it. It's the only way to get
 better. If I ever have any hope of writing a book then I need to
 be able to put in the time. Here's a start.
