iI picked up The Storymatic [0] at a toy store in Princeton today.
iIt's a box of cards that are used as writing prompts. The
iinstructions say to draw two of the gold character cards and one
iof the bronze lead-in cards. The two character cards together form
ia main character and the lead-in gets the story moving. Beyond
ithat there are only two rules:
i
i  1. The character must change in some way during the story. 
i  2. You cannot kill the main character 
i
iIt's a very simple system. I'm tempted to do a little data-entry
iand digitize the whole thing into a shell script. I just may do
ithat one night, but I'll fight the urge tonight. Instead tonight
iwill be spent actually using The Storymatic for its intended
ipurpose. I'll be creating a new section for writing exercsises [1]
iover in the Writing [2] section. If you're a fast gopher reader
ithat content might not be live yet, so come back in an hour or two
iand try again.
i
iI have a passion for writing but I don't spend the time to develop
imy craft. There's no excuse for it. It's the only way to get
ibetter. If I ever have any hope of writing a book then I need to
ibe able to put in the time. Here's a start.
