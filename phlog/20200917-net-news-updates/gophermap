iLast year I wrote a guide on how I set up net news (USENET) on		gopher.black	70
iCosmic Voyage [0]. It's designed not to peer with the big USENET,		gopher.black	70
ibut rather with other tilde servers to make a micro net news		gopher.black	70
inetwork just for us. That post is still valid and if you run		gopher.black	70
ia tilde or pubnix and want to peer with cosmic, reach out and let		gopher.black	70
ime know.		gopher.black	70

iSince Tilde Club rejoined the fold and has become an active member		gopher.black	70
iof the tildeverse, deepend has been good enough to set up a net		gopher.black	70
inews node there as well. We ran into some challenges with the		gopher.black	70
ipeering setup early on due to IPV6, but that's been solved. Now		gopher.black	70
iwe're growing together and learning new tricks.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTilde Club opened up its access for using net news remotely, not		gopher.black	70
ijust from the local system [1]. If you want to jump into the		gopher.black	70
iconversation now and aren't on Cosmic or Club, you can follow the		gopher.black	70
iinstructions there to do so.		gopher.black	70

iUser xwindows was chatting with me today about a mission to fix		gopher.black	70
ithe few problems we have remaining on the network. Perhaps the		gopher.black	70
imost important is the expiration of old messages. As of this phlog		gopher.black	70
iClub is set to expire net news messages after only 15 days.		gopher.black	70
iHopefully that will be rectified in the next few days, but also		gopher.black	70
iwe're working on a way to suck in all the old posts off cosmic to		gopher.black	70
irefill the system. Cosmic's posts are set to expire after 1 year,		gopher.black	70
iso it has much more post data to share with the rest of the		gopher.black	70
inetwork. Today's immediate challenge was that cosmic didn't have		gopher.black	70
ia method to view that data from outside cosmic itself. Unlike Club		gopher.black	70
iI hadn't set up external access.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWith a bit of investigation and some trial & error that has been		gopher.black	70
ifixed. If you connect to cosmic.voyage from an external net news		gopher.black	70
iclient you can get a read-only view of everything on the system.		gopher.black	70
iIf your net news client allows you to pass login information and		gopher.black	70
iyou use your cosmic voyage username and password (it was in your		gopher.black	70
iwelcome email if you forgot), then you should be able to post to		gopher.black	70
ithe newsgroups in addition to reading.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe only change required to make this happen was in		gopher.black	70
i'readers.conf':		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  auth "localhost" {		gopher.black	70
i      hosts: "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, stdin"		gopher.black	70
i      default: "<localhost>"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  access "localhost" {		gopher.black	70
i      users: "<localhost>"		gopher.black	70
i      newsgroups: "*,!junk,!control,!control.*"		gopher.black	70
i      access: RPA		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  auth "default" {		gopher.black	70
i      hosts: "*"		gopher.black	70
i      auth: "ckpasswd -s"		gopher.black	70
i      default: "anonymous"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  access regular {		gopher.black	70
i      read: "*,!junk,!control,!control.*"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  access full {		gopher.black	70
i      users: "*,!anonymous"		gopher.black	70
i      newsgroups: "*,!junk,!control,!control.*"		gopher.black	70
i  }		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe first two blocks handle local access which is basically saying		gopher.black	70
iif you're on cosmic you're good to go. Post away.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe three blocks following set up a two-case scenario for everyone		gopher.black	70
ielse. If you connect and successfully auth your user will be set		gopher.black	70
ito whatever your username is. If not, you get the default name		gopher.black	70
i"anonymous". Then I have a blanket rule for everyone to be able to		gopher.black	70
iread everything, and finally a special rule for everyone not named		gopher.black	70
ianonymous allowing posting.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo far testing seems to be working alright!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOh, and one last thing... If you want to make sure your expiration		gopher.black	70
isettings are nice and long (say... 1 year) then I'm pretty sure		gopher.black	70
iyou only need to change one line near the bottom of 'expire.ctl':		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  *:A:1:365:never		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSee the 365? make sure that's not something smaller, like 15.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut just in case, here's the other two mentions of 365 in my		gopher.black	70
iconfig files:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  # innreport.conf		gopher.black	70
i  cycle 365;		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  # inn.conf		gopher.black	70
i  artcutoff: 365		gopher.black	70
