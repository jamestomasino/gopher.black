iKetosis is a metabolic state in which some of the body's energy		gopher.black	70
isupply comes from ketone bodies in the blood, in contrast to		gopher.black	70
ia state of glycolysis in which blood glucose provides energy.		gopher.black	70
iGenerally, ketosis occurs when the body is metabolizing fat at		gopher.black	70
ia high rate and converting fatty acids into ketones.		gopher.black	70

iModafinil is a medication to treat sleepiness due to narcolepsy,		gopher.black	70
ishift work sleep disorder, or obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). While		gopher.black	70
iit has seen off-label use as a purported cognitive enhancer,		gopher.black	70
ievidence for any benefit is lacking.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCommon side effects include headache, anxiety, trouble sleeping,		gopher.black	70
iand nausea.		gopher.black	70

iAs mentioned previously in my phlog, I eat a ketogenic diet in		gopher.black	70
iorder to stay in a state of nutritional ketosis (a blood		gopher.black	70
iconcentration of Î²-hydroxybutyrate ketones in the range of 0.5-3.5		gopher.black	70
imillomolar). Eating this way and staying in ketosis gives me		gopher.black	70
ia number of benefits:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - Less hunger		gopher.black	70
i  - Easy avoidance of sugary foods		gopher.black	70
i  - Easy intermittent fasting		gopher.black	70
i  - Even energy levels throughout the day (no afternoon crash)		gopher.black	70
i  - Smoother, healthier skin (eczema goes away)		gopher.black	70
i  - Less inflamation in my joints		gopher.black	70
i  - Lower incidence of restless leg syndrome		gopher.black	70
i  - Increased mental clarity		gopher.black	70
i  - Lots of sexy food-porn on my Instagram		gopher.black	70
i  - Ability to talk about my diet for hours an annoy coworkers		gopher.black	70
i  - Easier weight loss		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn order to stay properly in ketosis and avoid the normal pitfalls		gopher.black	70
iI need to eat and drink a certain way. In short:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - Manage my macronutrients:		gopher.black	70
i    - Eat less than 20 grams of net carbs per day		gopher.black	70
i    - Hit my protein goal (~100 grams)		gopher.black	70
i    - Eat fat only until feeling sated		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  - Manage my micronutrients:		gopher.black	70
i    - Eat between 3-5 grams of sodium (yes, that's a lot)		gopher.black	70
i    - Eat at least 2 grams of potassium		gopher.black	70
i    - Get enough magnesium to avoid sleep and heart issues		gopher.black	70
i    - Otherwise make sure to hit my normal dietary needs for		gopher.black	70
i      vitamins & minerals		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf I do those things, ketosis happens. It's that simple. I don't		gopher.black	70
ibother to log anything in a food tracker anymore because it's		gopher.black	70
ibecome so intuitive. Huzzah!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI also occasionally take the drug modafinil as a cognative		gopher.black	70
ienhancer when I need to GET SHIT DONE. Based on my current supply,		gopher.black	70
ilast order, and a bit of math I average 1 dose every 3 weeks. Not		gopher.black	70
itoo shabby, if I do say so myself. In the past I've had stretches		gopher.black	70
iwhere I've found it helpful to take more, and I've had holidays		gopher.black	70
ifrom it where I forget I even have it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe effects of modafinil are interesting. If I were to boil it		gopher.black	70
idown to the essence I would say it increases your ability to focus		gopher.black	70
iand quickly manage task-switching. A side benefit of that focus is		gopher.black	70
ithat I seem to have more motivation to do the tasks in front of		gopher.black	70
ime. I can juggle more projects and input at once. Writing is		gopher.black	70
ismoother and more efficient, and often much longer than it would		gopher.black	70
ibe otherwise. If I have a pile of work that really needs my full		gopher.black	70
iattention and I want to tear through it with gusto, that's when		gopher.black	70
iI'll pop the pill. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIts primary purpose was for use by the military to enable high		gopher.black	70
icongnative functioning without sleep. It does that very well. If		gopher.black	70
iI take a pill anytime after 9am, I will not get to sleep before		gopher.black	70
i1am. It is very easy to pop one in the afternoon and coast on		gopher.black	70
ithrough the night without noticing. I don't use it that way, but		gopher.black	70
imany others do. I generally wake up early on days I plan to take		gopher.black	70
ia pill and pop it around 6am, then get to work.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSince it functions in similar ways to caffiene, I've found it's		gopher.black	70
ibest for me to avoid coffee while "modded up". It triggers anxiety		gopher.black	70
iin me which is detrimental to GETTING SHIT DONE. Modafinil also		gopher.black	70
imakes it easy to forget about food and drink. It's an appetite		gopher.black	70
isuppresant and your focus on work can distract you from healthy		gopher.black	70
ihabits like drinking water. This is a big mistake, too. Modafinil		gopher.black	70
iwill crush your brain with suck if you don't drink a crapload of		gopher.black	70
iwater. Headache central over here.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSince I need a lot of water for ketosis and also for modafinil		gopher.black	70
iI made sure to focus on that today while I was doing both. So far		gopher.black	70
iI'm sharp as a tack, motivated, and clear of headaches. The		gopher.black	70
ieffects of mental clarity from modafinil and ketosis do seem to		gopher.black	70
istack somewhat. All in all, they seem well suited to one another.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iNow I'm off to drink another liter of water to keep it that way.		gopher.black	70
