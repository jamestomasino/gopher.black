iThese questions come from christyotwisty [0]. I'll do my best to		gopher.black	70
ianswer them as other's have [1].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat is the first book you remember loving?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  This is a little embarrassing now, since I've grown to discover		gopher.black	70
i  what a horrific little man the author is, but the first book and		gopher.black	70
i  series I grew to love was Vale of the Vole [2], book 10 in the		gopher.black	70
i  Xanth series by Piers Anthony. My dad brought it home one day		gopher.black	70
i  and I gave it a shot. It hooked me quick and sent me back to the		gopher.black	70
i  beginning of the series. I read a bunch of them before		gopher.black	70
i  graduating on to better fantasy books. It put a life-long love		gopher.black	70
i  of the genre into my blood.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat book/series would you like to see adapted to film?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The Wheel of Time has long been my answer to this. It's epic on		gopher.black	70
i  a scale that many series strive for and can't quite achieve.		gopher.black	70
i  It's part of the central canon of fantasy literature, love it or		gopher.black	70
i  hate it, and it's never been given a fair shot at the screen.		gopher.black	70
i  I would love to see it done well, but fear it as well.		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i  Adaptations no longer belong to the author. They need to		gopher.black	70
i  maximize their medium and be the best they can be in that form.		gopher.black	70
i  This is why Dune is so hard to put on screen. The book is		gopher.black	70
i  philosophy and philosophy makes for terrible films. It causes		gopher.black	70
i  directors to over-use voice-over for internal thoughts. The		gopher.black	70
i  Wheel of Time would make for excellent on-screen action without		gopher.black	70
i  getting too lost in translation. Even so, will a film match the		gopher.black	70
i  story I love or will I be disgusted by the inevitable changes		gopher.black	70
i  that need to be made?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWho are your favourite protagonists?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I get deep satisfaction from characters that take a beating but		gopher.black	70
i  keep up the snark only to eventually do something epic. Harry		gopher.black	70
i  Dresden pops to mind as an example, as does Nona Grey from the		gopher.black	70
i  Book of the Ancestor series. Even Helen Harper's guilty pleasure		gopher.black	70
i  urban fantasy series "The Lazy Girl's Guide to Magic" has such		gopher.black	70
i  a heroine in Ivy Wilde. Joe Bishop of the Expeditionary Force		gopher.black	70
i  takes his knocks and then starts inter-stellar civil wars. Nancy		gopher.black	70
i  A. Collins' Sonja Blue does it too.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  While they may not share the snark, characters who endure		gopher.black	70
i  endless hardship with positivity, ingenuity, and resolve also		gopher.black	70
i  dig into my heart for all time. The hero of Hatchet and Julie of		gopher.black	70
i  the Wolves did that to me in middle school. And it's why my		gopher.black	70
i  favorite character from any book is still Jane Eyre. I mean...		gopher.black	70
i  the quotes!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i     "Do you think I am an automaton? — a machine without feelings?		gopher.black	70
i     and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my		gopher.black	70
i     lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you		gopher.black	70
i     think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am		gopher.black	70
i     soulless and heartless? You think wrong! — I have as much		gopher.black	70
i     soul as you — and full as much heart! And if God had gifted		gopher.black	70
i     me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as		gopher.black	70
i     hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you. I		gopher.black	70
i     am not talking to you now through the medium of custom,		gopher.black	70
i     conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh: it is my spirit		gopher.black	70
i     that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed		gopher.black	70
i     through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal — as we		gopher.black	70
i     are!"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i     "I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless,		gopher.black	70
i     the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Damn, son!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWho are your favourite antagonists?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The Baron Harkonnen in all his forms and genetic memory takes		gopher.black	70
i  it. He is brilliant and disgusting. Hannibal Lecter is delicious		gopher.black	70
i  too. Going old-school, Lady MacBeth was the first villain to		gopher.black	70
i  make me throw a book across a room (honorable mention to Iago).		gopher.black	70
i  Oh, and freakin' Mars itself in the Martian. It threw everything		gopher.black	70
i  it could at our hero, but took a swift sciencey kick to the		gopher.black	70
i  face.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat, so far, is the best book you've read this year?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The Collapsing Empire (The Interdependency #1) by John Scalzi.		gopher.black	70
i  It's a lovely new sci-fi series that just release book #2. If		gopher.black	70
i  you're into Scalzi's stuff it doesn't disappoint. There's some		gopher.black	70
i  epic stuff, some really nice mysteries, and colorful characters		gopher.black	70
i  gallore. I hope it goes on and on.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iCan you list three to five of your favourite authors? 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Genre greats like Brandon Sanderson, Frank Herbert, Robert		gopher.black	70
i  Jordan, George R.R. Martin, Mary Stewart, and John Scalzi.		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i  Classic literature is dominated by my girl Charlotte Bronte.		gopher.black	70
i  		gopher.black	70
i  Poets like Mary Oliver, Christina Rosetti, and Elizabeth Barrett		gopher.black	70
i  Browning.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhy are they your favourite?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  They create worlds where I can lose myself. They create		gopher.black	70
i  characters who I internalize and who become a part of me. And		gopher.black	70
i  they speak truth to my soul.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat are your least favourite genres to read?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Romance is a no-go to me. Same with whatever fluffy nonsense you		gopher.black	70
i  call Elin Hilderbrand's stuff. Horror is also not often on the		gopher.black	70
i  list. I don't find it scary, so it's mostly just gross or		gopher.black	70
i  depressing. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat was the last book you recommended to a friend?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Sebastien De Castell's "Traitor's Blade", book one of the		gopher.black	70
i  Greatcoats Series. When did I recommend it? Why, right now of		gopher.black	70
i  course. You should pick it up!  		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat is your favourite film adaptation of a book?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The Firm. It stands out as a fantastic example of the film being		gopher.black	70
i  better than the book. It doesn't happen often!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat books have you read the most times?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Dune, far and away. After that, Jane Eyre.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat fictional world or novel's setting would you like to live in?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  That's such a tricky question. So many of the fantasy worlds		gopher.black	70
i  I read are amazing places, but horribly dangerous. Or they would		gopher.black	70
i  be awesome to live in if I had one of the magic powers. The same		gopher.black	70
i  goes for sci-fi series. If I weren't running out of air on		gopher.black	70
i  a runaway space station, it might be cool!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  I've read a bunch of Star Trek novels, though, so I'm gonna take		gopher.black	70
i  the easy way out and say I'd like to live in the Federation.		gopher.black	70
i  Give me a future of peace where humanity struggles to improve		gopher.black	70
i  itself. (Side note, The Economics of Star Trek is also an		gopher.black	70
i  amazing book. Read that too.)		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat are your favourite classic books?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Oh, I should have looked ahead at this list. Jane Eyre for		gopher.black	70
i  fiction, but I love a lot of others too. The classical reads of		gopher.black	70
i  stoicism, like Epictetus and Aurelius's stuff is special to me.		gopher.black	70
i  So is Summa Theologica, though I admit skimming large portions.		gopher.black	70
i  There's Martin Chuzzlewit and the Iliad, or Introduction to the		gopher.black	70
i  Devout Life. So many great reads.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat is the most recent book you didn't expect to like, yet did?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The Trumpet of Terror! It's a Choose Your Own Adventure book and		gopher.black	70
i  I picked it to read on my show because the cover looked awful,		gopher.black	70
i  but it turned out to be really well written.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you could meet one author, living or dead, whom would it be?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Hmm, probably Frank Herbert. It's not a particular desire of		gopher.black	70
i  mine in general, but I'd like to know from his own mouth where		gopher.black	70
i  he wanted the series to go before his son butchered it.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat authors do you think more people should read?		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Don't be afraid of classics. Most of them have stuck around for		gopher.black	70
i  a reason. :)		gopher.black	70
