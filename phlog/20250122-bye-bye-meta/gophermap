iI nuked most of the content from my Facebook account today, and		gopher.black	70
icompletely destroyed my Instagram account. But tomasino, why were		gopher.black	70
iyou on Facebook? Great question, nerds.		gopher.black	70

iIceland runs on Facebook. It's really weird. Well, not really if		gopher.black	70
iyou consider that Iceland has been at the top of the charts of the		gopher.black	70
imost online citizens in the world almost nonstop since gopher came		gopher.black	70
ion the scene. It was number one for most of that time, but never		gopher.black	70
ireally lower than 4th on the list. People here are really, really		gopher.black	70
iconnected, and the circles are quite homogeneous. It's estimated		gopher.black	70
ithat 91% of all Icelanders are on Facebook. And that causes some		gopher.black	70
iproblems (obviously).		gopher.black	70

iSince they can assume you're on there, most businesses don't		gopher.black	70
ibother with websites. Restaurants, coffee shops, all of them, just		gopher.black	70
ia Facebook page. I can order Indian food over Facebook messenger.		gopher.black	70
iI signed my kid up for the summer farm camp over messenger. Worse,		gopher.black	70
imy son's school communications come via Facebook group. It's		gopher.black	70
ireally not a practical option to not participate.		gopher.black	70

iSo when we moved here I got sucked back in. My wife avoided it,		gopher.black	70
iand I took one for the team.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iBut here we are in this darkest of timelines, and I can't justify		gopher.black	70
igiving Meta any more than they've already stolen. So what do I do?		gopher.black	70
iI become a ghost.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI've deleted every bit of content I have on Facebook except a post		gopher.black	70
itelling people why and where else to find me. But I kept the		gopher.black	70
iaccount. I can see those school groups. I can book a table. I'll		gopher.black	70
iuse end-to-end encryption when I need to use messenger, and then		gopher.black	70
idelete the chats anyway. Minimum viable engagement.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iInstagram though... there's no reason to have it. Boom, gone.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI figured telling gopher was the best way to share. :)		gopher.black	70
