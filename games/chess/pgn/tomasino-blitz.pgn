{ Orlando was trying out a potential variation of the Caro-Kann opening against 1. d4. We played a quick, informal blitz game to put it to the test. Things quickly traded down to pawns and rooks before taking an interesting turn. To be fair, this was anything but a normal game for him, and certainly not indicitive of his play style. While I don't normally save my blitz games at all, this end-game was just too interesting, and demanded to be included here. }
