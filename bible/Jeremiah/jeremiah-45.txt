  The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of
Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the dictation of
Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king
of Judah: “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:
You said, ‘Woe is me! For the LORD has added sorrow to my pain. I
am weary with my groaning, and I find no rest.’ Thus shall you say
to him, Thus says the LORD: Behold, what I have built I am breaking
down, and what I have planted I am plucking up—that is, the whole
land. And do you seek great things for yourself? Seek them not, for
behold, I am bringing disaster upon all flesh, declares the LORD.
But I will give you your life as a prize of war in all places to
which you may go.”
