To the choirmaster: according to The Dove on Far-off Terebinths. A
Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath.

    Be gracious to me, O God, for man tramples on me;
        all day long an attacker oppresses me;
    my enemies trample on me all day long,
        for many attack me proudly.
    When I am afraid,
        I put my trust in you.
    In God, whose word I praise,
        in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.
        What can flesh do to me?


    All day long they injure my cause;
        all their thoughts are against me for evil.
    They stir up strife, they lurk;
        they watch my steps,
        as they have waited for my life.
    For their crime will they escape?
        In wrath cast down the peoples, O God!


    You have kept count of my tossings;
        put my tears in your bottle.
        Are they not in your book?
    Then my enemies will turn back
        in the day when I call.
        This I know, that God is for me.
    In God, whose word I praise,
        in the LORD, whose word I praise,
    in God I trust; I shall not be afraid.
        What can man do to me?


    I must perform my vows to you, O God;
        I will render thank offerings to you.
    For you have delivered my soul from death,
        yes, my feet from falling,
    that I may walk before God
        in the light of life.
