A Song of Ascents.

    To you I lift up my eyes,
        O you who are enthroned in the heavens!
    Behold, as the eyes of servants
        look to the hand of their master,
    as the eyes of a maidservant
        to the hand of her mistress,
    so our eyes look to the LORD our God,
        till he has mercy upon us.


    Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us,
        for we have had more than enough of contempt.
    Our soul has had more than enough
        of the scorn of those who are at ease,
        of the contempt of the proud.
