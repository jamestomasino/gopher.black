To the choirmaster. Of David, for the memorial offering.

    Make haste, O God, to deliver me!
        O LORD, make haste to help me!
    Let them be put to shame and confusion
        who seek my life!
    Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor
        who delight in my hurt!
    Let them turn back because of their shame
        who say, “Aha, Aha!”


    May all who seek you
        rejoice and be glad in you!
    May those who love your salvation
        say evermore, “God is great!”
    But I am poor and needy;
        hasten to me, O God!
    You are my help and my deliverer;
        O LORD, do not delay!
