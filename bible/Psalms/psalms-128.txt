A Song of Ascents.

    Blessed is everyone who fears the LORD,
        who walks in his ways!
    You shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands;
        you shall be blessed, and it shall be well with you.


    Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
        within your house;
    your children will be like olive shoots
        around your table.
    Behold, thus shall the man be blessed
        who fears the LORD.


    The LORD bless you from Zion!
        May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
        all the days of your life!
    May you see your children's children!
        Peace be upon Israel!
