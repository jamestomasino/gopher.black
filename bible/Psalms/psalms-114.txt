    When Israel went out from Egypt,
        the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
    Judah became his sanctuary,
        Israel his dominion.


    The sea looked and fled;
        Jordan turned back.
    The mountains skipped like rams,
        the hills like lambs.


    What ails you, O sea, that you flee?
        O Jordan, that you turn back?
    O mountains, that you skip like rams?
        O hills, like lambs?


    Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
        at the presence of the God of Jacob,
    who turns the rock into a pool of water,
        the flint into a spring of water.
