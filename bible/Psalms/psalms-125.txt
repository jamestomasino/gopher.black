A Song of Ascents.

    Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion,
        which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
    As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
        so the LORD surrounds his people,
        from this time forth and forevermore.
    For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest
        on the land allotted to the righteous,
    lest the righteous stretch out
        their hands to do wrong.
    Do good, O LORD, to those who are good,
        and to those who are upright in their hearts!
    But those who turn aside to their crooked ways
        the LORD will lead away with evildoers!
        Peace be upon Israel!
