A Song of Ascents. Of David.

    O LORD, my heart is not lifted up;
        my eyes are not raised too high;
    I do not occupy myself with things
        too great and too marvelous for me.
    But I have calmed and quieted my soul,
        like a weaned child with its mother;
        like a weaned child is my soul within me.


    O Israel, hope in the LORD
        from this time forth and forevermore.
