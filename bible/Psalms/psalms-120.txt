A Song of Ascents.

    In my distress I called to the LORD,
        and he answered me.
    Deliver me, O LORD,
        from lying lips,
        from a deceitful tongue.


    What shall be given to you,
        and what more shall be done to you,
        you deceitful tongue?
    A warrior's sharp arrows,
        with glowing coals of the broom tree!


    Woe to me, that I sojourn in Meshech,
        that I dwell among the tents of Kedar!
    Too long have I had my dwelling
        among those who hate peace.
    I am for peace,
        but when I speak, they are for war!
