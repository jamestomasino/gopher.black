i# Yarrow Stalk Method
i
iA.  Preparation
i
i    1.  Take 50 yarrow stalks in hand
i    2.  Set one aside. I place it in the distance in the center of the table
i        and use it as a bridge to lay out the final groups
i
i
iB.  Step 1 of 3
i
i    1.  Focus your mind on the question posed to the oracle
i    2.  Fan out the remaining stalks in left hand
i    3.  Quickly grab a portion into the right hand
i    4.  Take one stalk from right hand and put it between pinky and ring
i        finger of your left hand.
i    5.  Place remaining right-hand bundle down to the right of the table
i    6.  Left Reduction Sequence:
i        - Remove 4 yarrow stalks from your left hand and place them to the
i          left of the table.
i        - Repeat the removal of 4 yarrow stalks until there are 4 or fewer
i          remaining in the left hand
i        - Place the remaining yarrow stalks between your left ring finger and
i          middle finger.
i    7.  Pick up the pile on the right of the table and place in left hand
i    8.  Right Reduction Sequence:
i        - Remove 4 yarrow stalks from your left hand and place them to the
i          right of the table
i        - Repeat the removal of 4 yarrow stalks until there are 4 or fewer
i          remaining in the left hand
i        - Place the remaining yarrow stalks between your middle finger and
i          index finger
i    9.  Take the stalks from between your fingers and lay the group, together,
i        on the left side of the first discarded stalk. If this is the first set
i        of reductions for this line, set the extra pinky/ring finger stalk to
i        the side of the center stick. Don't include it in future gatherings and
i        don't count it as part of that set.
i
i    Check your work: Your pile will have either 4 or 8 stalks.
i
i
iC.  Step 2 of 3
i
i    1.  Focus your mind on the question posed to the oracle
i    2.  Gather the yarrow stalks from the left and right sides of the table
i        back into your left hand.
i    3.  Fan out the stalks in the left hand
i    4.  Quickly grab a portion into the right hand
i    5.  Take one stalk from right hand and put it between pinky and ring finger
i        of your left hand.
i    6.  Place remaining right-hand bundle down to the right of the table
i    7.  Left Reduction Sequence:
i        - Remove 4 yarrow stalks from your left hand and place them to the left
i          of the table.
i        - Repeat the removal of 4 yarrow stalks until there are 4 or fewer
i          remaining in the left hand
i        - Place the remaining yarrow stalks between your left ring finger and
i          middle finger.
i    8.  Pick up the pile on the right of the table and place in left hand
i    9.  Right Reduction Sequence:
i        - Remove 4 yarrow stalks from your left hand and place them to the
i          right of the table
i        - Repeat the removal of 4 yarrow stalks until there are 4 or fewer
i          remaining in the left hand
i        - Place the remaining yarrow stalks between your middle finger and
i          index finger
i    10. Take all the stalks from between your fingers and lay the group,
i        together, in the center of the first discarded stalk.
i
i    Check your work: Your second pile will either have 4 or 8 stalks.
i
i
iD.  Step 3 of 3
i
i    1.  Repeat the same actions from Step 2 of 3
i    2.  Place the final pile on the right of the first discarded stalk.
i
i    Check your work: Your third pile will either have 4 or 8 stalks.
i
i
iE.  Calculate the line of the hexagram
i
i    1.  Each pile of 4 is worth 2 points. Each pile of 8 is worth 3 points.
i    2.  Add the total points together for each of the 3 piles.
i
i        6 points = Changing Yang => Solid becomes Broken
i        7 points = Unchanging Yin => Broken remains Broken
i        8 points = Unchanging Yang => Solid remains Solid
i        9 points = Changing Yin => Broken becomes Solid
i
i    3.  Draw your lines of the hexigram from the bottom to the top.
i    4.  Gather all the 49 stalks back together and begin again
i    5.  Repeat all steps until you have completed the 6 lines of the hexigram
i    6.  Look up the hexigram and its changed form
