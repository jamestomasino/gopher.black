iShakuhachi Music, Notes, and More	
i---------------------------------	

iThe Shakuhachi is an Japanese end-blown bamboo flute. It is tuned	
ito the pentatonic minor scale, but is capable of producing	
ivirtually any pitch in a roughly 3 octave range. It is a Zen	
imedatative instrument, but can also be used for traditional	
iJapanese ensemble music, western folk, jazz, and more.	

iNot only is the instrument capable of any pitch, but it offers	
iextreme variety in tones and coloring by subtle changes in	
iembouchere and movement of the head to modify the air-flow over	
ithe blowing edge (utaguchi).	

iMusic for the Shakuhachi spans a lot of different styles.	
iIn the eastern traditions there are the following general styles:	

i  doyo         - Children's songs	
i  minyo        - Folk tunes	
i  shinkyoku    - Music composed between 1900-1950	
i  gendai kyoku - Modern music	
i  san kyoku    - Trio music for shakuhachi, koto, and shamisen	
i  honkyoku     - Classical shakuhachi music for Zen meditation,	
i                 or a free-form in this style
