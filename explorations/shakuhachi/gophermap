 Shakuhachi Music, Notes, and More
 ---------------------------------

 The Shakuhachi is an Japanese end-blown bamboo flute. It is tuned
 to the pentatonic minor scale, but is capable of producing
 virtually any pitch in a roughly 3 octave range. It is a Zen
 medatative instrument, but can also be used for traditional
 Japanese ensemble music, western folk, jazz, and more.

 Not only is the instrument capable of any pitch, but it offers
 extreme variety in tones and coloring by subtle changes in
 embouchere and movement of the head to modify the air-flow over
 the blowing edge (utaguchi).

 Music for the Shakuhachi spans a lot of different styles.
 In the eastern traditions there are the following general styles:

   doyo         - Children's songs
   minyo        - Folk tunes
   shinkyoku    - Music composed between 1900-1950
   gendai kyoku - Modern music
   san kyoku    - Trio music for shakuhachi, koto, and shamisen
   honkyoku     - Classical shakuhachi music for Zen meditation,
                  or a free-form in this style
