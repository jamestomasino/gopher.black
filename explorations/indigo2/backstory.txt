My first exposure to *nix was at Rowan University in the computer
science department on IRIX systems running on SGI Indys and
Indigo2s. In early 2018, @louks@mastodon.sdf.org on Mastodon sent
me an Indigo2 he had but wasn't using. These documents will
chronical my efforts to get the system up and running and offering
free public access.
