iProject: Root/hack Kindle Voyage into a fabulous e-ink terminal.

iHardware info:

i  Wi-Fi MAC Address: 78:E1:03:36:78:3C
i  Serial Number: 9013 0907 7253 0162
i  Model Number: NM460GZ
i  Model Name: Kindle Voyage WiFi
i  Model Nickname: KV
i  Firmware Version: Kindle 5.9.2.0.1 (3262860017)

iStep 1: Factory Reset

i  - Menu -> Settings -> Reset Device
i  - Re-register device
i  - Fully charge device
i  - Turn on Airplane mode

i  NOTE: Never use factory reset after jailbreaking. It will wipe
i  out the ability to use the jailbreak survival code

iStep 2: Downgrade Firmware

i  - Get Serial #
i  - Use Serial to get model number & nickname [0]
h[0] Kindle Serial Numbers	URL:http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Serial_Numbers
i  - Find the appropriate Model's old firmware.

i  NOTE: If you get the wrong model's firmware, it will brick the
i  device. I'm using KV_5.5.0, found with a google search.

i  - Plug in Kindle via USB to computer
i  - Copy bin file to the root directory on Kindle drive, next to
i    /documents
i  - Unmount USB, remove USB cable, wait 10 minutes
i  - Home -> Menu -> Settings -> Menu -> Update Your Kindle

i  NOTE: If the Update Your Kindle option doesn't delay coming up,
i  and remounting reveals the file is missing on the device, this
i  method will not work with your current firmware.

i  That's where I ended up! Time to try it with an older spare
i  kindle model, or wait for a new jailbreak option to come out for
i  the Voyage.

iI started all over again with my Kindle Touch. This time the
iprocess was pretty simple!

iHardware info:

i  Wi-Fi MAC Address: F0:A2:25:BD:94:6F
i  Serial Number: B00F 2607 1453 0F5Q
i  Model Number: D01200
i  Model Name: Kindle Touch
i  Model Nickname: K5 or KT
i  Firmware Version: Kindle 5.3.7.3 (2715280002)

iStep 1: Factory Reset

i  - Menu -> Settings -> Reset Device
i  - Re-register device
i  - Fully charge device
i  - Turn on Airplane mode
i  - Disable accidental OTA updates by dropping a folder in the
i    root directory named "update.bin.tmp.partial". Leave it
i    empty and all your worries are no more.

iStep 2: Jailbreak!

i  - There's a bunch of resources, but start here [1]:

i  - Find your kindle model and its index page for reference [2]:
h[2] K5 Index	URL:http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/K5_Index
i  - Now, find your jailbreak [3]:

i  - It wasn't clear to me right away, but you basically grab the
i    file, drop it into the root folder of the Kindle, then run
i    the updater. Don't just reboot the Kindle, use the updater.
i  - Once the update is done, THEN reboot it once more.

iStep 3: USBNetwork

iThis will install some thingies so you can connect to the device
iover USB where the USB acts like a network card.
i
i  - Grab the USBNetwork installer and drop it in the device root.
i    Install it just like the jailbreak. It's in the same link as
i    before [3].
i  - I did this part from my Windows 7 device, so I had to fix the
i    drivers for the USB plug. Windows 7 has the proper driver,
i    but I had to manually select it. I went into device manager,
i    clicked that improperly installed thing, manually selected
i    a driver for "Microsoft Corporation" and there it was. All
i    better.
i  - After that, you need to edit the network connection that
i    comes up and modify the IPv4 settings to point to the device
i    IP: 192.168.15.244

iStep 4: Getting Access
i
iFinally, SSH in... only it doesn't work. Remember, there's
ia password on the root account that's random. We need to get an
issh key into the authorized keys so we can access the device.

i  - Disable networking by going to the search field on the kindle
i    and entering ";un". It's a toggle, so if you did it right you
i    should be able to plug in the kindle and mount it as USB. If
i    not, enter the code again and try again.
i  - Browse the SD card for the ssh folder. You'll have to create
i    the authorized_keys file and paste in a public key for
i    whatever system you're connecting from. (Device isn't in
i    front of me, so I forget the path. I need to come back and
i    add that here for posterity)
i  - Unmount, ";un" once again, and try to SSH now while plugged
i    in. It should work. It did for me.

iStep 5: Wifi

iOnce you can get in via the USBNetwork, you should be able to get
iin via wifi too.

i  - In the kindle search type ";711". This will give you the
i    Kindle's info. There may be multiple pages to click through.
i    On page 2 for me was the wifi address of the Kindle. If your
i    Kindle isn't connected to a network, you won't see anything.
i    You can tether to your phone in a pinch.
i  - Grab that ip and SSH to root@<kindle.wifi.ip.address>. It
i    should log you right in just like the USBNetwork did. If not,
i    you might need to enable wifi logins. It's in the config file
i    on the SD card which you can edit when mounted as a USB
i    device, or when logged in as root from USBNetwork after
i    changing the system to read-write (instructions in the shell
i    when you log in)

iStep 6: Loading stuff

iThere's launchers and apps and stuff you can put on your kindle
inow. You do this work over USB while mounted, not in Network
imode.  
i
i  - Toggle networking with ";un" again if you need in order to
i    mount oven USB.
i  
i  TODO: add info about installing package manager thingies and
i  launcher, recommend some apps, and talk about using kterm to
i  connect to a remote shell and sharing the screen via tmux or
i  screen, thus using the Kindle as a display.
