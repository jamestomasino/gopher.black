 Project: Root/hack Kindle Voyage into a fabulous e-ink terminal.

 Hardware info:

   Wi-Fi MAC Address: 78:E1:03:36:78:3C
   Serial Number: 9013 0907 7253 0162
   Model Number: NM460GZ
   Model Name: Kindle Voyage WiFi
   Model Nickname: KV
   Firmware Version: Kindle 5.9.2.0.1 (3262860017)

 Step 1: Factory Reset

   - Menu -> Settings -> Reset Device
   - Re-register device
   - Fully charge device
   - Turn on Airplane mode

   NOTE: Never use factory reset after jailbreaking. It will wipe
   out the ability to use the jailbreak survival code

 Step 2: Downgrade Firmware

   - Get Serial #
   - Use Serial to get model number & nickname [0]

   - Find the appropriate Model's old firmware.

   NOTE: If you get the wrong model's firmware, it will brick the
   device. I'm using KV_5.5.0, found with a google search.

   - Plug in Kindle via USB to computer
   - Copy bin file to the root directory on Kindle drive, next to
     /documents
   - Unmount USB, remove USB cable, wait 10 minutes
   - Home -> Menu -> Settings -> Menu -> Update Your Kindle

   NOTE: If the Update Your Kindle option doesn't delay coming up,
   and remounting reveals the file is missing on the device, this
   method will not work with your current firmware.

   That's where I ended up! Time to try it with an older spare
   kindle model, or wait for a new jailbreak option to come out for
   the Voyage.

 I started all over again with my Kindle Touch. This time the
 process was pretty simple!

 Hardware info:

   Wi-Fi MAC Address: F0:A2:25:BD:94:6F
   Serial Number: B00F 2607 1453 0F5Q
   Model Number: D01200
   Model Name: Kindle Touch
   Model Nickname: K5 or KT
   Firmware Version: Kindle 5.3.7.3 (2715280002)

 Step 1: Factory Reset

   - Menu -> Settings -> Reset Device
   - Re-register device
   - Fully charge device
   - Turn on Airplane mode
   - Disable accidental OTA updates by dropping a folder in the
     root directory named "update.bin.tmp.partial". Leave it
     empty and all your worries are no more.

 Step 2: Jailbreak!

   - There's a bunch of resources, but start here [1]:

   - Find your kindle model and its index page for reference [2]:
h[2] K5 Index	URL:http://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/K5_Index
   - Now, find your jailbreak [3]:

   - It wasn't clear to me right away, but you basically grab the
     file, drop it into the root folder of the Kindle, then run
     the updater. Don't just reboot the Kindle, use the updater.
   - Once the update is done, THEN reboot it once more.

 Step 3: USBNetwork

 This will install some thingies so you can connect to the device
 over USB where the USB acts like a network card.
 
   - Grab the USBNetwork installer and drop it in the device root.
     Install it just like the jailbreak. It's in the same link as
     before [3].
   - I did this part from my Windows 7 device, so I had to fix the
     drivers for the USB plug. Windows 7 has the proper driver,
     but I had to manually select it. I went into device manager,
     clicked that improperly installed thing, manually selected
     a driver for "Microsoft Corporation" and there it was. All
     better.
   - After that, you need to edit the network connection that
     comes up and modify the IPv4 settings to point to the device
     IP: 192.168.15.244

 Step 4: Getting Access
 
 Finally, SSH in... only it doesn't work. Remember, there's
 a password on the root account that's random. We need to get an
 ssh key into the authorized keys so we can access the device.

   - Disable networking by going to the search field on the kindle
     and entering ";un". It's a toggle, so if you did it right you
     should be able to plug in the kindle and mount it as USB. If
     not, enter the code again and try again.
   - Browse the SD card for the ssh folder. You'll have to create
     the authorized_keys file and paste in a public key for
     whatever system you're connecting from. (Device isn't in
     front of me, so I forget the path. I need to come back and
     add that here for posterity)
   - Unmount, ";un" once again, and try to SSH now while plugged
     in. It should work. It did for me.

 Step 5: Wifi

 Once you can get in via the USBNetwork, you should be able to get
 in via wifi too.

   - In the kindle search type ";711". This will give you the
     Kindle's info. There may be multiple pages to click through.
     On page 2 for me was the wifi address of the Kindle. If your
     Kindle isn't connected to a network, you won't see anything.
     You can tether to your phone in a pinch.
   - Grab that ip and SSH to root@<kindle.wifi.ip.address>. It
     should log you right in just like the USBNetwork did. If not,
     you might need to enable wifi logins. It's in the config file
     on the SD card which you can edit when mounted as a USB
     device, or when logged in as root from USBNetwork after
     changing the system to read-write (instructions in the shell
     when you log in)

 Step 6: Loading stuff

 There's launchers and apps and stuff you can put on your kindle
 now. You do this work over USB while mounted, not in Network
 mode.  
 
   - Toggle networking with ";un" again if you need in order to
     mount oven USB.
   
   TODO: add info about installing package manager thingies and
   launcher, recommend some apps, and talk about using kterm to
   connect to a remote shell and sharing the screen via tmux or
   screen, thus using the Kindle as a display.
