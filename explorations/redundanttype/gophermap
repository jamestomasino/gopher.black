i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAccording to RFC 1436:		gopher.black	70
i  + Item is a redundant server		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  The information applies to a duplicated server.  The information		gopher.black	70
i  contained within is a duplicate of the primary server.  The primary		gopher.black	70
i  server is defined as the last DirEntity that is has a non-plus		gopher.black	70
i  "Type" field.  The client should use the transaction as defined by		gopher.black	70
i  the primary server Type field.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy interpretation is that the + entries are fallbacks for the		gopher.black	70
iprevious DirEntity type above it.  		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDirEntity in RFC 1436 is defined as:		gopher.black	70
i  DirEntity ::= Type User_Name Tab Selector Tab Host Tab Port CR-LF		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iAs a fallback, it's unclear if the "User_Name" section of the		gopher.black	70
iredundant (+) DirEntity should display in addition to the primary		gopher.black	70
iDirEntitiy, or if only the primary should be shown and the		gopher.black	70
iredundant entries used by the client as fallback in case of		gopher.black	70
ia server error response.		gopher.black	70

iWhat follows is a test implementation of the + type that can be		gopher.black	70
ireferenced by gopher client developers in their testing:		gopher.black	70
