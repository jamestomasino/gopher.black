iGopher Redundant Server Type	
i----------------------------------------	
i	
iAccording to RFC 1436:	
i  + Item is a redundant server	
i	
i  The information applies to a duplicated server.  The information	
i  contained within is a duplicate of the primary server.  The primary	
i  server is defined as the last DirEntity that is has a non-plus	
i  "Type" field.  The client should use the transaction as defined by	
i  the primary server Type field.	
i	
iMy interpretation is that the + entries are fallbacks for the	
iprevious DirEntity type above it.  	
i	
iDirEntity in RFC 1436 is defined as:	
i  DirEntity ::= Type User_Name Tab Selector Tab Host Tab Port CR-LF	
i	
iAs a fallback, it's unclear if the "User_Name" section of the	
iredundant (+) DirEntity should display in addition to the primary	
iDirEntity, or if only the primary should be shown and the	
iredundant entries used by the client as fallback in case of	
ia server error response. The UMN Gopher client seems to prefer	
ithis later style, where only the primary DirEntity is visible to	
ithe end user.	
i	
iWhat follows is a test implementation of the + type that can be	
ireferenced by gopher client developers in their testing:
