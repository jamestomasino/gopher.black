----------------------------------------
Gopher Redundant Server Type
----------------------------------------

According to RFC 1436:
  + Item is a redundant server

  The information applies to a duplicated server.  The information
  contained within is a duplicate of the primary server.  The primary
  server is defined as the last DirEntity that is has a non-plus
  "Type" field.  The client should use the transaction as defined by
  the primary server Type field.

My interpretation is that the + entries are fallbacks for the
previous DirEntity type above it.  

DirEntity in RFC 1436 is defined as:
  DirEntity ::= Type User_Name Tab Selector Tab Host Tab Port CR-LF

As a fallback, it's unclear if the "User_Name" section of the
redundant (+) DirEntity should display in addition to the primary
DirEntitiy, or if only the primary should be shown and the
redundant entries used by the client as fallback in case of
a server error response.

What follows is a test implementation of the + type that can be
referenced by gopher client developers in their testing:
