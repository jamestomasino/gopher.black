i# START SPINNING - by Maggie Casey
i## Everything You Need to Know to Make Great Yarn

iThis book came with the Ashford Traditional wheel I bought from eBay. It
iwas also a recommended book on Goodreads for first time spinners.

i- Spinning is balancing between twist and draft
i- Spinning happens in the "triangle"
i- Start with the tension loose and slowly tighten until it grabs
i- Wool is the easiest fiber to start with
i- If you have difficulty drafting:
i    - You may need hands further apart (length of fiber)
i    - You may have twist on the fiber (untwist)
