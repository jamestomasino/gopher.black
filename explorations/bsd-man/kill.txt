This is a great example of why going through man pages is helpful.
I've been using kill(1) for years and years but never went through
the details to learn things as simple as "what are all the
signals?"

kill -l # boom

Or, broadcast a signal to ALL procesess by targeting -1! (Can
someone tell me when you'd ever want to do this?)

Oooh, and kill -0 can be used to test if a process exists! That
sounds moderately useful in scripts.
