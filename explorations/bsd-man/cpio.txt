The best I can tell this is an early form of file archiving which
has been mostly replaced on modern systems with tar. RPM uses or
used it fairly recently, hence it's still around in the core set
of tools.

I think I can just ignore it for the time being and look up the
syntax in case I ever run into it in the wild.
