## Chapter 3 : Syntax in Functions

- As-patterns - Appear easy to overlook/forget
- guards, where, let, and case - Need practice in all of them. They look

## Chapter 5 : Higher-Order Functions

- (.) vs ($) was confusing. This summarizes their fundemental differences
  thanks to the #haskell channel on freenode:
  (f $ g x) === f (g x)  --while--  (f . g x) === (\y -> f ((g x) y))
