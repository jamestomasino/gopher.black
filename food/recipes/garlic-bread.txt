Garlic Bread
----------------------------------------

Ingredients

    1 long loaf Italian bread
    2 cloves garlic (more or less to taste)
    1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
    1 pinch ground black pepper
    1 tablespoon onion salt
    1/2 tablespoon butter
    1 pinch rosemary (optional)

Directions

    - Preheat the oven's broiler.

    - Add oil, black pepper, and onion salt to a small pot over low heat.

    - Mince garlic cloves very fine and add to oil.

    - Add butter to oil and stir until well mixed.

    - Let the mixture stew over the heat for a few minutes to allow the garlic
      flavor to permeate the oil.

    - Slice bread lengthwise and place on broiling pan with the cut portion
      facing up.

    - (Optional) Use a toothpick to poke small holes into the top of the bread.
      Puncture about halfway down. The oil will spread more evenly into the bread
      this way.

    - Spoon out the oil and garlic mixture onto the bread. Be sure to evenly
      distribute the garlic and allow time for the oil to seep into the bread.

    - Broil the bread for approximately 5 minutes or until the edges are golden
      brown.

    - Optionally, crush a pinch of rosemary over the bread to add a flavorful
      hint and some color.
