(The beggining of the clip has horrible feedback before the stream
is fixed right at the 8 minute mark.)

Tonight we finished up the Romeo storylines in Romeo and/or Juliet
by Ryan North. We managed to not die horribly and get not one, but
two happily ever after endings!

Also, we learned a lot about eating, drinking, and breathing.

Helpful knowledge!
