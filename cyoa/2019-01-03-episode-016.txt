Tonight we journey into the stars, or maybe some old man’s head
with what looks like a gear-driven lightbulb. Careful of the
golden bowling pins. They look sneaky!

What will we discover? We will travel far beyond the bounds of our
universe into the inane and silly, into thought itself. We’ll
ponder great mysteries. We’ll remember old TV shows about Canadian
mounties. We’ll probably exist only in the dreams of
christyotwisty. You don’t want to miss this episode.

Opening music by the Beastie Boys, but only a little bit because
tomasino is bad at streaming and forgot how to configure audio
sinks.

Outro by Pink Floyd.

PEW PEW PEW!!!
