Tonight we read Rock and Roll Mystery by Jim Wallace, Book 69 of
Choose Your Own Adventure

As cat put it, “It’s like Netflix wanted to make a ‘dark & edgy’
remake of Jem and the Holograms”.

Despite the awfulness of the book itself, we have a bunch of fun
together. Intro music is a metal version of the Unsolved Mysteries
Theme, and we wrap up with a “Choose Your Own Drum-Solo”
vicariously through Phil Collins’ In the Air Tonight
