    Zork #4: Conquest of Quendor

    The fourth book in the Zork series, the “Conquest of Quendor”,
    featured silly riddles reminiscent of Zork II. Bivotar and
    Juranda search for the Helm of Zork in an attempt to bring
    peace to the Land of Frobozz, in defiance of Jeearr,
    a riddle-telling demon. There are 17 possible endings.

    Romeo and/or Juliet

    What if Romeo never met Juliet? What if Juliet got really buff
    instead of moping around all day? What if they teamed up to
    take over Verona with robot suits? This choose-your-own-path
    version of Romeo and Juliet—packed with fun puzzles, secrets,
    and quadrillions of possible storylines—lets you decide where
    the plot goes every time you read. You might play as Romeo, or
    as Juliet, or as both of them at the same time. You might even
    unlock additional playable characters!

    That’s right. We figured out how to have unlockable characters
    in books.

Listen to the initial openVOIP archive. I've removed the first
half of the stream before I dialed in. There's still quite a bit
of robot take-over interrupting the story.

Episode 0 (open-mic):

We began reading the Zork story during an OpenVOIP. We’ll pick up
where we left off at the top of this episode, then continue on
with a reading of Romeo and/or Juliet. Will we finish both
stories? Will we die horrible deaths over and over? Will there be
robots?

Join me on Friday at 0100 UTC (Thursday night at 9PM EST) to find
out. Message me on Mastodon ( @tomasino@mastodon.sdf.org ) or on
SDF’s com, or IRC, and join the discussion.

In this show, the choices are yours!
