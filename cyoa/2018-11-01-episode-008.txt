Tonight's show delved into the depths of doom down in the dreary Dungeon of
Dread by Rose Estes. We laughed, we cried, we died horribly.

How can you have any pudding if it doesn't eat your meat?

SDF admin iczer joined us tonight and we hit a new record in listeners. The
book was excellent and massive fun acquired. Give it a listen!

    - Intro music was the Anvil of Crom by Basil Poledouris
    - Background music and sound effects are from Naegi Ki - RPG Ambiance
      Fantasy #03 INTO THE DEPTHS OF DUNGEON.
    - Outro music was an instrumental version of the Dungeons & Dragons TV show
      credits.
