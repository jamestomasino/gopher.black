Tonight we finished reading the second half of ZORK #2: The
Malifestro Quest by S. Eric Meretzky. Then we got a tiny start on
next week's book, The Trumpet of Terror by Deborah Lerme Goodman
which was surprisingly well written! Make sure to join us next
week for that adventure.

Tonight we led to our deaths by the listeners four or five times
before we managed to reach the 10 out of 10 point ending.
