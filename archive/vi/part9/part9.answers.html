<h3><a name="double"></a>Answer to <code><strong>:ab</strong></code>
Overload Exercise</h3>


<p>In every case, the other meaning would prevail over the
<code><strong>:ab</strong></code> meaning.  Reason: all the other
metacharacters and metastrings take effect as soon as the last character
of the string is typed in.  But an abbreviation doesn't take effect until
you type the next following character in, proving that your string was a
word by itself.  So the other metavalue will always be triggered first.

<h3><a name="multi"></a>Answer to Multi-Line Problem </h3>


<p>There are various uses for making some source-file commands
unexecutable from screen mode.  Here are two examples.  </p>


<ol>


<li>You have a source file that makes complex changes in a certain
area of your file, then prints the modified lines so you can look over
the changes.  But when you are in screen mode, the changes are displayed
anyway, so the line-mode <code><strong>print</strong></code> command only
duplicates the display -- but it does require you to hit the return key
and wait for a screen repaint before you can continue screen editing.
Putting the command to print on a second line makes sure printing will
only happen when you need it.  </li>


<li>Your source file automates a lot of detail when you are doing a
routine cleanup of an imported file while in line mode.  But when the
file is too messed up for a blind cleanup from line mode, and you must
work from screen mode, a few of the commands in your source file are
likely to do more harm than good.  When those few commands are on a
second line in the file, they only run when you are doing routine work
from line mode.  </li>
</ol>
