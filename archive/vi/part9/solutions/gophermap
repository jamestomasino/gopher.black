iAnswer to :ab Overload Exercise	
i	
i  In every case, the other meaning would prevail over the :ab	
i  meaning.  Reason: all the other metacharacters and metastrings	
i  take effect as soon as the last character of the string is typed	
i  in. But an abbreviation doesn't take effect until you type the	
i  next following character in, proving that your string was a word	
i  by itself.  So the other metavalue will always be triggered	
i  first.

iAnswer to Multi-Line Problem 	
i	
i  There are various uses for making some source-file commands	
i  unexecutable from screen mode.  Here are two examples.  	
i	
i  You have a source file that makes complex changes in a certain	
i  area of your file, then prints the modified lines so you can look	
i  over the changes.  But when you are in screen mode, the changes	
i  are displayed anyway, so the line-mode print command only	
i  duplicates the display -- but it does require you to hit the	
i  return key and wait for a screen repaint before you can continue	
i  screen editing. Putting the command to print on a second line	
i  makes sure printing will only happen when you need it.  	
i	
i  Your source file automates a lot of detail when you are doing a	
i  routine cleanup of an imported file while in line mode.  But when	
i  the file is too messed up for a blind cleanup from line mode, and	
i  you must work from screen mode, a few of the commands in your	
i  source file are likely to do more harm than good.  When those few	
i  commands are on a second line in the file, they only run when you	
i  are doing routine work from line mode.
