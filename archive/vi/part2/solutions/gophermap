 Solution to "EXPORT" Problem
 
   Typing:
   
     1 ; ?EXPORT? delete
   
   will do it.  By starting from the first line in the file and
   searching backwards, you guarantee the the first line to be
   searched will be the last line of the file (due to wraparound),
   then the second-to-last line, etcetera.  As soon as the editor
   finds a match it stops, so there cannot be another "EXPORT" lower
   down in the file.
   
   
   Solution to First-Line Problem
   
   This requires two commands:
   
     $ print
     /EXPORT/ delete
   
   The first command prints the last line in the file, which is not
   helpful in itself, but also leaves that last line as the current
   line. Then, the address of the second command causes a forward
   search and, due to wraparound, the search must begin with the
   file's first line.
 
 
 Solution to Noninclusive Problem
 
   Just add a plus sign after the address before the comma, and a
   minus sign to the address after it, like this:
   
     ?abc? + , /xyz/ -
   
   Each of these offsets moves one line toward the center of the text
   section the combined address specifies, so each has the effect of
   leaving out the line where the match was found.  (That the first
   search was backward and the second forward is not relevant.  The
   point is that the address before the comma, whatever it is,
   receives the plus offset, while the address after the comma gets
   the minus offset.)
