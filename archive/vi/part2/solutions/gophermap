iSolution to "EXPORT" Problem	
i	
i  Typing:	
i  	
i    1 ; ?EXPORT? delete	
i  	
i  will do it.  By starting from the first line in the file and	
i  searching backwards, you guarantee the the first line to be	
i  searched will be the last line of the file (due to wraparound),	
i  then the second-to-last line, etcetera.  As soon as the editor	
i  finds a match it stops, so there cannot be another "EXPORT" lower	
i  down in the file.

i  Solution to First-Line Problem	
i  	
i  This requires two commands:	
i  	
i    $ print	
i    /EXPORT/ delete	
i  	
i  The first command prints the last line in the file, which is not	
i  helpful in itself, but also leaves that last line as the current	
i  line. Then, the address of the second command causes a forward	
i  search and, due to wraparound, the search must begin with the	
i  file's first line.

i	
iSolution to Noninclusive Problem	
i	
i  Just add a plus sign after the address before the comma, and a	
i  minus sign to the address after it, like this:	
i  	
i    ?abc? + , /xyz/ -	
i  	
i  Each of these offsets moves one line toward the center of the text	
i  section the combined address specifies, so each has the effect of	
i  leaving out the line where the match was found.  (That the first	
i  search was backward and the second forward is not relevant.  The	
i  point is that the address before the comma, whatever it is,	
i  receives the plus offset, while the address after the comma gets	
i  the minus offset.)
