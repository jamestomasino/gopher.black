  - Be patient. No matter what.
  - Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing
    of another you wouldn’t say to him.
  - Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble
    than yours are to you.
  - Expand your sense of the possible.
  - Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.
  - Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.
  - Tolerate ambiguity.
  - Laugh at yourself frequently.
  - Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.
  - Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
  - Give up blood sports.
  - Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don’t risk
    it frivolously.
  - Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are
    sometimes exempt.)
  - Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.
  - Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission
    and pursue that.
  - Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.
  - Praise at least as often as you disparage.
  - Admit your errors freely and soon.
  - Become less suspicous of joy.
  - Understand humility.
  - Remember that love forgives everything.
  - Foster dignity.
  - Live memorably.
  - Love yourself.
  - Endure.
