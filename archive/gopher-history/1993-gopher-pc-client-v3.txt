Subject: PC Gopher III version 1.00 Released

The latest version of the new DOS gopher client, PC Gopher III
version 1.00, is now available via gopher to gopher.tc.umn.edu,
or anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu, in /pub/gopher/PC_client.

Once again, BE SURE THAT YOU GET RID OF THE OLD .REZ FILE
before running this version.  This will be the last time you
have to do this, as I've added a version marker to the file;
future versions will update the .REZ file if it's fairly
recent, otherwise just create a new one and stomp on your
old configuration settings.  Life is hard.

---------------------------------
            Fixed Bugs
---------------------------------

  * QEMM 6.0 -- PC Gopher III is "executing an illegal
  instruction"; this was a long-standing bug in the TCP
  driver, which was also causing "system integrity
  violation" errors when run under Windows.  Thanks to
  George Gonzalez and Earl Schleske for fixing this (and,
  incidentally, for supplying all of the versions of PC
  Gopher with their TCP/IP guts).

  * fixed embarrassing "out of heap space" errors, forever.
  I think.

  * fixed a memory leak in the textfile save routine

  * changed the overlay strategy, moving approximately 40K
  from the executable file into the overlay file

  * secondary server support added

  * fixed text-formatting glitch

  * fixed nagging standard file dialog bug (actually, Earl
  fixed this one)

  * single-window mode windows, when scrolled down from the
  top position, were giving birth to mutant children with
  mangled scrollers.  Fixed.

---------------------------------
          Added Features
---------------------------------

  * added a version marker to the resource file, to simplify
  upgrades to future releases

  * text window and browser window positioning code works in
  a more rational manner (or at least in what I consider to
  be a more rational manner)

---------------------------------
           Unfixed Bugs
---------------------------------

  * I've had a few reports of "Error 210, Object not
  initialized". Anyone who sees this -- PLEASE send mail and
  let me know EXACTLY what the sequence of events is to
  reproduce it.  It's a rare, intermittent bug, the worst
  kind...

  * status indicator in browser and textwindow frames should
  keep the byte count visible at all times

  * if there's a non-single-window mode browser on the
  screen, and you switch to single-window mode, you have to
  open a new browser to get the "Go Back" button to appear

  * in single-window mode, a failed query shouldn't close the
  window

  * reposition windows when changing video mode

  * where's the help system?

  * why isn't there a manual?

  * peek in gplustest/ask/e-mail directory crashes client

  * empty directories shouldn't be displayed

  * need window tile and cascade functions

  * small CSO dialog needs status line

  * search text should be preserved across CSO lookups when
  using large CSO dialog box

  * null/blank queries to index servers need to be filtered
  out

  * should be able to choose large or small CSO dialog as
  default

Have fun, and keep reporting bugs!
