If you look at the history of Gopher and WWW, it appears they were
conceived and discussed at about the same time (mid 1991) and deployed
at roughly the same pace. But Gopher seems to be winning: There are 400
or so registered Gopher servers on the net; over 1100 are indexed by
Veronica. There are about 50 Web servers. Gopher is currently number
about number 10 in the list of applications generating traffic on the
NSFnet backbone; WWW is 50. Both are growing rapidly. (These numbers are
somewhat biased; WWW is more popular in Europe, so NSFnet numbers don't
cover it; also, Gopher "front ends" a lot of WAIS data.) Why is Gopher
ahead?

At the recent meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force in Columbus
OH, this question was raised more than once. There was a "Birds of a
Feather" session for WWW, and another one for Gopher. We had about 23
folks at the WWW session; there were about 54 at the Gopher one. Tim
Berners-Lee, the principal architect of WWW, asked how many were running
Web servers -- answer 3 or 4. At the Gopher BOF, I asked how many folks
run Gopher servers -- answer just about all 54 attendees.

Reasons given as to why Gopher is "winning":

1. Client software is available on popular platforms (PC, Mac)

2. Good VT100 support via "curses" client

3. The perception that hypertext is inherently complicated, always
   leading to a "twisty maze of passages all alike" (this perception is
   of course not shared by WWW adherents)

4. The relative ease of setting up a server. Some folks have a Gopher
   server running within an hour or two of downloading the package.
   Initial WWW setup takes quite a but longer. (One attendee reported
   that the installation documentation came in HTML, the markup language
   used by WWW, creating an interesting bootstrap problem)

5. U Minn as a central registry in the US, providing a visible "home
   page" for all Gophers

6. Gopher is very strong at linking to various document types. You can
   point a Gopher server at a Unix mail file, a WAIS server, or an FTP
   site, and  you've got an instant gateway.

... but there may be solutions to all this:

1. NCSA says Mosaic will be available under other platforms (PC, Mac) at
   some point. Cornell Law School is working on a multipurpose client by
   the name of Cello.  Others will surely come.

2. The curses client for WWW provided by Kansas with Lynx seems to fill
   this bill.

3. WWW folks feel that this is a bad rap for hypertext. As folks get
   more experience with hypertext documents in various systems, they'll
   accept it more. A Gopher tree can be represented in a Web; one need
   not build a complicated mesh of interwoven links. Hypertext just
   means you can have links within documents.

4. Tim Berners-Lee said there are some improvements to server
   administration that could be implemented. He mentioned simplifying
   setup of rules files.

5. There's no reason why a visible master WWW registry couldn't be
   prominently documented

6. This sort of functionality could be added or enhanced in WWW.
   (Perhaps someone from the Web community could share with us what's
   possible here.  Can Web use WAIS indexing?  Can it point to WAIS
   SRCs as easily as Gopher can?)

We've been running a Gopher service since early 1992, and we're very
active in the community. But after seeing Mosaic and WWW, it is very
hard to deny the benefits of networked hypertext. Via Mosaic I showed
Berners-Lee our Gopher at Michigan State. The first document we opened
says "Look in the xxx folder for more information." B-L said "Now with
WWW that would be an embedded pointer." In Mosaic, the hypertext links
appear in color within the document. Links you've clicked on appear in a
different color -- a nice touch. An example of a lovely use of WWW is an
experiment at Ohio State, where they made a cross-referenced set of Unix
'man' pages. You see a reference to another page; the title is in red on
the screen; click on it if it is of interest;  it's on your screen.

After IETF I showed all this to my management. I think there's a very
good chance we'll want to migrate to the Web at some point within the
next year or so. I would urge all readers of this list to find someone
with an X-Windows capable workstation, get hold of Mosaic, and use it to
check out WWW.  Mosaic is worth seeing on its own, with nice features
such as infinite history of documents selected.

Working against Gopher lately has been the U Mn attitude towards the
software. There has been the licensing flap, which is chronicled in
comp.infosystems.gopher, and not worth rehashing here. Recently we had
another disappointment: for over a year we've been patching the U Mn
MS-DOS client, PC Gopher, to work with FTP Software Inc's suite
(supplying the fix to U Mn each time). Now U Mn won't share the source
code with us, saying that they will fix this themselves. This client was
announced on March 19, 1993. It's now May 1, and none of our users can
exploit this client. While U Mn is taking a more proprietary view of
their software, Berners-Lee is working to open up the license for WWW.

Despite all the above: Sites should not necessarily avoid Gopher as they
set up new services. Right now, today, you can get going quickly in
Gopher, and can serve virtually all users. When multipurpose clients
come out for PCs and Macs, you can migrate to the Web.  Already, one can
view a Gopher tree having started in the Web, so a server set up under
Gopher can deliver data to users after an announced migration to WWW.
(Ie a logical migration need not mean an immediate physical move of
data.) NCSA is even talking about providing a unified WWW/Gopher server.

This is followed by a number of reasons, which I agree with, but also feel
will be addressed in time. To my mind, there is another problem with WWW
which is inherent in all hypertext systems - the ongoing cost of preparing
material for the service.

To look at the narrow case of CWISes (for which Gopher seems very popular),
it would seem that the way forward is to distribute the Info provision role
across the institution - resulting in a diverse, and hopefully balanced,
collection of info. However, in doing this, a degree of editorial control
is lost. If we use WWW, who will put in the links? How will the systematic
and consistent use of links be maintained ... unless considerable (and
expensive) effort is directed towards this?

I do not dismiss WWW as a valuable tool - but, in general purpose applications,
it may prove to expensive to use. And unless the linkages can be maintained
to a high standard, the prime benefit of WWW is lost. As in all hypertext
systems, WWW can only be as good as the "link-author" makes it. We've probably
all seen examples of good and bad PC/MAC based hypertext applications. In my
experience, the good ones are narrowly focused, and written by an individual
or under strong editorial control. The worst ones are inconsistent
incomplete and contain 'black holes'. I don't see how the latter can be
avoided in the case of general info systems with multiple sources (except
at great expense).

No no no no no.  This is one of the BIG falacies about WWW.
You don't HAVE to write hypertext. The fact that a number of
people have written some very nice hypertext out there doesn't
mean you can't just run a W3 server on your Gopher data.

If you take the NCSA public domain W3 server and run it just
like you run your Gopher server.  I mean, put it in the same
way into inetd.conf and point it at the same directory.
It will pick up the same .cap and other magic gopher files
and make a nice hypertext tree up for you.
So if you are readingthis and you are running a gopher server,
you can go pick up the NCSA httpd server fron ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu
and slot it in right away, and you are on the web.

Sure, you might too find that you wnat to write some hypertext
just for the welcome page at lease... but these is NO ongoing cost.

If you use Gopher, who will put in the links?  WWW and Gopher
both have the ability to point from one node to any other node.
The webs you make with Gopher and those you make with WWW have
the same topology.  The difference is NOT in the topology.  It is
in the format of a node.  In Gopher, it is a MENU or a flat
document.  In WWW, it is a hypertext node which can be more
expressive than a menu.

(Already with the basic httpd server from CERN you get README
files put in above or below your directory listings, which
can allow you to include explanations which make your
web easier to follow)

Both WWW and Gopher have this problem. Any open system
of references has the problem that you can link to something not
under your control which then goes away.

This applies equally to WWW and Gopher.  In both cases, sticking
to a a basic hierarchical structure, and only putting external links
to things you have some confidence in, lead to a very useable system.
A few tools to check for dangling links are always useful, although
as servers can be down temporaily it is dangereous to delete
links on the first failure.

If (and only if) you do start to write real hypertext documents, then
I agree with your observations about good hypertexts. There is a
small style guide which is now part of the www server guide
(ftp://info.cern.ch/pub/www/doc/www-server-guide.ps)
or available online as
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Overview.html
which makes some suggestions for good online hypertext.
Any comments additions are welcome.
