PC Gopher II, the new Internet Gopher client for DOS-based
microcomputers, is now available for anonymous ftp from


  boombox.micro.umn.edu

in the directory


  /pub/gopher/PC_client/PC_Gopher_II

The directory contains the following files:

        GOPHER.EXE  The main executable file.
        GOPHER.OVR  The overlay file.
        GOPHER.REZ  The resource / configuration info file.
        REZGEN.EXE  A utility to generate a new resource file,
              should your old one get munged.
        GENV.BAT    An EXAMPLE of a batchfile to set up your
              environment properly for PC Gopher II - it's
              ONLY an example, and won't work if you don't
              modify it to suit your environment!
        About_PCGII List of changes, etc.

        PCGII.ZIP   All of the above, archived with PKZIP

        PCG2_SRC.ZIP  The source files, Turbo Pascal v6.0, and the
                TCP/IP driver, IBMTCP.DVR
        PKUNZIP.EXE          A program to unarchive the .ZIP files
        00README                  This file, more or less.


REMEMBER TO SET THE FTP TRANSFER MODE TO BINARY BEFORE YOU GRAB
THESE FILES.

Also, be sure to read the accompanying file About_PCGII!  Many things
have changed between the old PC Gopher and PC Gopher II; if you just
grab the executable and run it, you will certainly run into trouble!

A quick rundown of what's new:

1. Support for the Gopher <--> WAIS gateway

2. Minimal support for CSO servers

3. Path to telnet application is now read from the environment

4. Fully overlaid; overlay buffer kept in EMS if available.

5. Directory cacheing

In order to run PC Gopher II, you'll need a packet driver; the
version 9 distribution of the Clarkson packet drivers is available in
the directory


   /pub/gopher/PC_client/drivers


All available previous versions have all been moved to a directory
called


   /pub/gopher/PC_client/old_client


Bug reports, flames, beer, and cash should all be sent to:


   gop...@boombox.micro.umn.edu
