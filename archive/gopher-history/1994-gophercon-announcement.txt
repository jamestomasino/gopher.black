                     sponsored by
              The University of Minnesota

The University of Minnesota is pleased to announce the Internet
Gopher Conference '94. The major focus of this year's "GopherCon"
will be:

    - Bringing the new gopher administrator up to speed.
      Much of the recent growth in gopherspace is coming
      from communities new to the Internet, including small
      colleges and secondary education.

    - Showcasing interesting Gopher applications, including
      clients, servers, tools, new subject areas (commercial,
      K-12, etc.)

    - A forum for gopher software developers to discuss
      new gopher attribute types, administrative
      tools, and new functionality.

We welcome folks from the gopher community who would like to make a
presentation, run a tutorial, showcase their application, or run a
guided tour  of their service to do so.  Conference fees will be
waived for presenters. For more information on presenting a
session please send e-mail to gophe...@boombox.micro.umn.edu.
