The meat was off. Oliver smelled it the moment it slid through the
slot. Two rosy masses piled atop a tin tray. It didn't matter. He'd
eat it all. Complaint meant nothing.

Mattress springs groaned as he rolled toward the door. Three steps.
Stop. Turn. Three steps. Stop. His world arrayed before him.
A sliver of light from far above touched on dust motes or smoke too
fine for Oliver to make out with his poor eyes. Motes, he decided.
Smoke meant bad meat and he pushed the thought away.

Tin felt cold against thick knuckles. It was soothing and he let
the moment linger. Meat ment Monday. Bad meat and cursing joints
meant winter.

His last two fingers became his spoon and several minutes passed.
His foot pressed the clean tray under the door. Quiet time would
come now, for hours, left alone with his thoughts. His thoughts
only. They didn't know that's what he needed. They thought this
torture, or maybe it was ignorance and irrelevance. Maybe they just
forgot about him. Oliver knew himself again because of it, whatever
their reasons.

"Hey," he said to himself aloud, into the empty tower. A slow smile
crept across chapped lips and he laughed. It was a raspy, tired
thing with more chill in it than the creaking bones.

"Hello, Mr. Dean," a deep voice answered from outside the door.
