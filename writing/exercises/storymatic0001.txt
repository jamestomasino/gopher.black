The meat was off. Oliver smelled it the moment it slid through the
slot. Two rosy masses piled atop a tin tray. It didn't matter. He'd
eat it all. Complaint meant nothing.

Mattress springs groaned as he rolled toward the door. Three steps.
Stop. Turn. Three steps. Stop. His world arrayed before him.
A sliver of light from far above touched on dust motes or smoke too
fine for Oliver to make out with his poor eyes. Motes, he decided.
Smoke meant bad meat and he pushed the thought away.

Tin felt cold against thick knuckles. It was soothing and he let
the moment linger. Meat meant Monday. Bad meat and cursing joints
meant winter.

His last two fingers became his spoon and several minutes passed.
He pressed the clean tray under the door with his foot and settled
back on his rack. Quiet time would come now, for hours, left alone
with his thoughts. His thoughts only.

They didn't know that's what he needed. They thought this torture.
Or maybe it was ignorance and irrelevance behind it all. Maybe
they just forgot about him. Oliver knew himself again because of
it, whatever their reasons.

"Hey, old man," he said aloud to himself in the empty tower.
A slow smile crept across chapped lips and he laughed. It was
a raspy, tired thing with more chill in it than the creaking
bones. "This what you wanted?"

A high squeal echoed in the chamber outside. His laughing stopped.
Footsteps began, very far away at first then closer. A rattle,
jingle, keys then. He licked his lips and took a slow breath.
This wasn't right. They were too soon. It was the quiet time. He
looked upward at the light far above and the edge it drew on the
high wall. It was quiet time. The visitor stopped just outside his
door with the soft scratching of a rubber sole on concrete; the
shadows of legs revealed at the crack by the floor.

"--lost in park, hidden away, alone. She wore the yellow jumper.
Oliver K.--keep it straight--focus and--" a little voice grew
inside Oliver's mind then silenced itself. A guard then. Someone
prepared, thankfully.

Heavy metal thudded somewhere deep in the wall and his door
opened. An unfamiliar face looked down on Oliver. "Barnes," the
identity came unbidden. Better to start off in power. He might
still avoid the beating.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Barnes," Oliver greeted with a squint into
the new light and a crooked grin. "Welcome to nowhere."

If there was any indication that Barnes was shocked by Oliver's
guessing his name he hid it well. Mr. Barnes might as well be the
familiar stone walls for all that he let show in face or mind.
Barnes held still a long time, impassive face staring him down.
Oliver gave in first, massaging his knuckles and breaking eye
contact.

"What's it then? Questions?" Oliver offered.

"Questions." Barnes replied. He stepped back away from the door
giving way for Oliver to follow. No chains this time. Something
had changed, indeed. Oliver rose slowly and took his three steps
to the doorway. Then after a beat, a fourth into the hall. His
eyes found Barnes' again as he listened hard for some indication
as to what this was all about.

"--harpies everywhere--" a shrivelled sound in the back of his
mind replied. Harpies?

Barnes raised a baton Oliver hadn't noticed before and pointed
down the hallway toward a set of metal stairs. They started
walking, Oliver in front, Barnes a few steps behind, shuffling.
Oliver stretched out his right arm casually, tentatively, and
dragged his finger along the mortar line in the wall. A simple
thing that reminded him of the grey flats of his childhood. Barnes
didn't comment and Oliver was grateful at the little kindness.

An image of a country cottage came upon him, with a contraption in
his small backyard that held both drying laundry and shrieking
children at play. Large yellow flowers with radiant golden faces
and a young girl in yellow. The memory left him as fast as it
came, but a strange homesickness remained for a place he'd never
seen in person. There was a deep hopelessness in that memory, so
close to utter despair. Oliver knew in his heart that the despair
wasn't really his, but the feel of it was as real as any other.

Oliver's hand dropped from the wall and his steps became a shuffle
on the stairs. He pushed sorrow from his mind and forced himself
on until they reached the next level. Turning to the side Oliver
began the familiar walk toward interrogation room number one. It
was the only label he'd ever seen in this place, stenciled in
black paint on a metal door. Barnes shook the keys again and
Oliver felt the familiar searching feeling in the back of his mind
like pressing your hand into a sheet drying in the sun, trying to
see the shapes distorted by light and distance. But that was
wrong, the shape felt wrong.

"Wrong key, Barnes," Oliver said without looking. This time the
reaction wasn't stone. A flash of surprise and frustration and--

"--knitted cap in the bush. Broken line and footprint. Spinning on
the hoist. A diary in cherry ink--"

The door slid open silently on well oiled hinges. Oliver stepped
in and went straight to the plastic chair alone in the back of the
room. He sat and didn't know what to do with his hands at first
with them being free of restraints. He settled them on his lap and
held one with the other to keep from fidgeting or rubbing at his
knuckles. The room was as it always was, stark naked stone walls
covered in off-white paint. His familiar white plastic chair
belonged in a backyard, not this cell. The others across the room,
all four, were padded and sturdy, though all were empty. That was
as usual as well. They didn't like to complicate things with him
by adding more variables like that.

Barnes closed the door and came to stand in front of the four
seats, looking down on Oliver with a face of concentration. It
wasn't easy to keep so guarded and it showed. Oliver was tempted
to force it, but remembered the small kindness in the hallway. He
relaxed and settled back.

"Same as always? Where's the script?" Oliver began. "My name is
Oliver Kirc--"

"--No." Barnes interrupted. He stepped closer, too close. For
a moment Oliver thought Barnes might hit him. Then he spoke, "I
think you're a fraud. I think you're a twisted fuck, a psychopath,
a waste of space, and a fraud. I don't know how you do it and
I don't care. You're a waste of my time. Don't you dare play any
games with me." The last felt like a question, so Oliver nodded.

Barnes continued, "They say you know stuff you shouldn't know.
I don't give a piss what you know or don't know. You've been in
a box so long anything you know is long dead and gone." The tone
was harsh but it didn't fit him. There was nothing on his wrists,
and there was the kindness in the hall.

Oliver saw the grey flats in his mind and a flash of golden hair.
In the moment of memory the hair flew in circles and framed
a face that wouldn't resolve. Her hair was always crisp
as morning but her face--

"What do you want me to say?" Oliver asked. Mr. Barnes aimed
a scowl in response, but somehow it wasn't aimed toward him.
A show, then.

Oliver let out a slow breath and let his mind slip further into
the distance. There was something. Just barely at the edges.
"--HARPIES--" the word exploded and he let out a little cry.

The scowl washed off of Barnes giving Oliver his first real
look at the man unguarded. Sandy hair and a nondescript face that
never escaped baby fat. A soft face. A soft man. His eyes were
searching, trying to find... What? Truth? A secret? "--golden
sunshine in the breeze--". Questions, always their questions.

"It doesn't work like this," Oliver explained. "I can't see her.
I mean, I can, but not like that. This is a waste of time. Just
put me back."

Barnes' mouth opened and hung for a moment. He worked his jaw but
nothing came out. A click sounded somewhere in his skull and the
baby-faced man dropped down into one of the center chairs and
memories bled from him like a gushing wound.

It was Oliver's turn to put up walls. "Keep your thoughts to
yourself. I don't want them. I'm me again. Just go away." But none
of it was spoken aloud. He communicated with his slouching in the
white, plastic chair, gaze dropping to the side.

"You see her?"

"No, not like that," he sighed. His hand pulsed a dull throbbing
pain and he focused his attention there. Stay grounded. Stay
yourself. "I can't see other places. I keep telling them. It's not
like that"

"--yellow jumper, swinging high. The laughter, sharp like rain on
a tin roof--"

"Stop it!" Oliver half rose from his chair. "I don't want this.
I can't help you."

"Where is she, damnit? You know something. I can see it in your
face." Barnes softness was sliding away, face becoming ashen. He
was desperate. So hopelessly desperate.

"I don't work like that. The ferry docks, the Hills Hoist. I see
the sunflowers," Oliver tried to explain. He couldn't, though.
They never understood in time, before he lost himself. He didn't
want to remember that place. It was overwhelming, pulling him in.
The homesickness sat like an ache in his chest, a weight holding
him in the chair.

"You--How can you--" Barnes was soft. They should have sent
someone stronger. But they didn't send him, did they?

"They didn't send you, did they? You're different. How are you
different?"

"--A long corridor, a red door, another stencil and a number
higher than one--A cherry desk, imported, cigar smoke, a letter
opener from father for his graduation--The summer was chilly but
the thrill kept him warm."

No, not him, Barnes. Barnes was warmed. Oliver sat in a cell
buried under concrete, forgotten until someone needed their
questions answered. Bad meat and never enough water and a body
that screamed for him to just hurry up and die so it could all
end.
