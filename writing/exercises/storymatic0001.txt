The meat was off. Oliver smelled it the moment it slid through the
slot. Two rosy masses piled atop a tin tray. It didn't matter. He'd
eat it all. Complaint meant nothing.

Mattress springs groaned as he rolled toward the door. Three steps.
Stop. Turn. Three steps. Stop. His world arrayed before him.
A sliver of light from far above touched on dust motes or smoke too
fine for Oliver to make out with his poor eyes. Motes, he decided.
Smoke meant bad meat and he pushed the thought away.

Tin felt cold against thick knuckles. It was soothing and he let
the moment linger. Meat ment Monday. Bad meat and cursing joints
meant winter.

His last two fingers became his spoon and several minutes passed.
He pressed the clean tray under the door with his foot and settled
back on his rack. Quiet time would come now, for hours, left alone
with his thoughts. His thoughts only.

They didn't know that's what he needed. They thought this torture.
Or maybe it was ignorance and irrelevance behind it all. Maybe
they just forgot about him. Oliver knew himself again because of
it, whatever their reasons.

"Hey, old man," he said to himself aloud into the empty tower.
A slow smile crept across chapped lips and he laughed. It was
a raspy, tired thing with more chill in it than the creaking
bones. "This what you wanted?"

A high squeal echoed in the chamber outside. His laughing stopped.
Footsteps began, very far away at first then closer. A rattle,
jingle, keys then. He licked his lips again took a slow breath.
This wasn't right. They were too soon. It was the quiet time. He
looked upward at the light far above and the edge it drew on the
high wall. It was quiet time. The visitor stopped just outside his
door with a soft scratching of a rubber sole on concrete; the
shadows of legs revealed at the crack in the door.

"--lost in park, hidden away, alone. She wore the yellow jumper.
Oliver K.--keep it straight--focus and--" a little voice grew
inside Oliver's mind then silenced itself. A guard then. Someone
prepared, thankfully.

Heavy metal thudded somewhere deep in the wall and his door
opened. An unfamiliar face looked down on Oliver. "Barnes," the
identity came unbidden. Better to start off in power. He might
still avoid the beating.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Barnes," Oliver greeted with a squint into
the new light and a crooked grin. "Welcome to nowhere."

If there was any indication that Barnes was shocked by Oliver's
guessing his name he hid it well. Mr. Barnes might as well be the
familiar stone walls for all that he let show in face or mind.
Barnes held still a long time, impassive face staring him down.
Oliver gave in first, massaging his knuckles and breaking eye
contact.

"What's it then? Questions?" Oliver offered.

"Questions." Barnes replied. He stepped back away from the door
giving way for Oliver to follow. No chains this time. Something
had changed, indeed. Oliver rose slowly and took his three steps
to the doorway. Then after a beat, a fourth into the hall. His
eyes found Barnes' again as he listened hard for some indication
as to what this was all about.

"--harpies everywhere--" a shrivelled sound in the back of his
mind replied. Harpies?

Barnes raised a baton Oliver hadn't noticed before and pointed
down the hallway toward a set of metal stairs. They started
walking, Oliver in front, Barnes a few steps behind, shuffling.
Oliver stretched out his right arm casually, tentatively, and
dragged his finger along the mortar line in the wall. A simple
thing that reminded him of the grey flats of his childhood. Barnes
didn't comment and Oliver was grateful at the little kindness.

An image of a country cottage came upon him, with a contraption in
his small backyard that held both drying laundry and shreiking
children at play. Large yellow flowers with radiant golden faces
and a young girl in yellow. The memory left him as fast as it
came, but a strange homesickness remained for a place he'd never
seen in person. There was a deep hopelessness in that memory, so
close to utter despair. Oliver knew in his heart that the despair
wasn't really his, but the feel of it was as real as any other.

Oliver realized his hand had dropped from the wall and his steps
had become a shuffle on the stairs. He pushed sorrow from his mind
and forced each step high until they reached the next level.
Turning to the side Oliver began the familiar walk toward
interrogation room number one. It was the only label he'd ever
seen in this place, stenciled in black paint on a metal door.
Barnes shook the keys again and Oliver felt the familiar searching
feeling in the back of his mind like pressing your hand into
a soft sheet drying in the wind, trying to see the shapes
distorted by light and distance. But that was wrong, the shape
felt wrong.

"Wrong key, Barnes," Oliver said without looking. This time the
reaction wasn't stone. A flash of surprise and frustration and--

"--knitted cap in the bush. Broken line and footprint. Spinning on
the hoist. A diary in cherry ink--"

The door slid open silently on well oiled hinges. Oliver stepped
in and went straight to the plastic chair alone in the back of the
room. He sat and didn't know what to do with his hands at first
with them being free of restraints. He settled them on his lap and
held one with the other to keep from fidgeting or rubbing at his
knuckles. The room was as it always was, stark naked stone walls
covered in off-white paint. His familiar white plastic chair
belonged in a backyard, not this cell. The others across the room,
all four, were padded and sturdy, though all were empty. That was
as usual as well. They didn't like to complicate things with him
by adding more variables like that.

Barnes closed the door and came to stand in front of the four
seats, looking down on Oliver with a face of concentration. It
wasn't easy to keep so guarded and it showed. Oliver was tempted
to force it, but remembered the small kindness in the hallway. He
relaxed and settled back.

"Same as always? Where's the script?" Oliver began. "My name is
Oliver Kirc--"

"--No." Barnes interrupted. He stepped closer, too close. For
a moment Oliver thought Barnes might hit him. Then he spoke, "I
think you're a fraud. I think you're a twisted fuck, a psychopath,
a waste of space, and a fraud. I don't know how you do it and
I don't care. You're a waste of my time. Don't you dare play any
games with me." The last felt like a question, so Oliver knodded.

Barnes continued, "They say you know stuff you shouldn't know.
I don't give a piss what you know or don't know. You've been in
a box so long anything you know is long dead and gone."

Oliver saw the grey flats in his mind and a flash of golden hair.
In the moment of memory the hair flew in circles and framed
a face that wouldn't resolve in memory. Her hair was always crisp
as morning but her face.

"What do you want me to say?" Oliver asked.

[Finish the walk to the interrogation room]

[Interview crossed with memory of home offers alternative: helping]

[Argue with self, give in to temptation of something new]

[second guard arrives, discover betrayer, impotent to help]

[frustration at a new fear, loss, powerlessness]

[homesickness provides method of momentary escape, saves
interviewer]

[recognized power, silence is reward]
