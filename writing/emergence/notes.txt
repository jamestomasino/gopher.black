Book Blurb

Emergence is a speculative fiction about the birth of artificial
intelligence. It follows the scientists and business people
responsible for the project, the governments that want to control
it, and eventually the machine itself as computation becomes
thought and thought becomes intelligence. It asks questions about
the nature of life, our place in the universe, and ultimately good
vs evil.
