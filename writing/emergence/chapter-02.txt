                         "Secrets"

The cave was empty save the janitorial staff and the overnight
monitor. Pierre-Jean Trauffaut sipped a cola with an
unpronounceable nordic name and watched the logs slide by on
Frank's primary screen. Ever since the machine cleared the
bottlenecks things had gotten back to normal. Well, as normal as
can be for a monolithic quantum computer in an underground bunker.

Pierre-Jean's theory was playing out before him in real-time.
Algorithmic efficiency, the mathematical precursor to cognition.
It was here, right here, and it was working. He wasn't sure
exactly how the change would come about, but his proof was certain
it was going to happen. He felt it in his heart as well. Frank
would live, but it wouldn't be like the world expected. This was
no plaything imitating the human mind with its inconsistencies and
vagaries. Frank would emerge from pure mathematics itself. He
would be different. Better.

Pressing a button, he toggled the display from the general overlay
and selected one of the proofs Frank had marked as optimal. The
screen transformed into a white matte of mathematical symbols.
Pierre-Jean looked at the formulae spread out before him. The
display suggested that this proof was only 31 screens long. The
work that they'd gathered was collectively over a trillion paper
pages in length already and it pained him to know he'd never be
able to read it all. That was his limitation, and that of all
humans. Something new was needed to truly comprehend everything.

Math like this was Frank's language. One day this is how they
would communicate with him. For now, though, he felt like he were
looking over Frank's shoulder and reading a diary. It brought
a little naughty grin to his lips.

Somewhere nearby the squeaking wheel of a soap bucket announced
a janitor's presence. An air vent overhead kicked on, adjusting to
the small change in pressure and heat that the extra body created.
Inside a chamber cooled to nearly absolute zero a microwave
pulse triggered a coupling resonator and the array of qubits was
primed for a new calculation. The processes chained across 612
individual qubits and in an instant the result passed out of
the quantum core and back into Frank's traditional systems for
interpretation. The microwaves continued their dance with the
coupling resonators, repeating, learning.

There were only a handful of people in the world who had
sufficient training to understand what was happening inside those
boxes in the hazy mists. Every day that list grew shorter as Frank
increased in complexity. When the time eventually came that
Frank's work was completely unintelligible then a new science
would emerge for humans. Children being born today would grow up
in a world where there were answers to questions we had never
thought to ask. Instead of testing the mysteries of existence
through expirementation we would study the arcane scripture of
a new god.

But this bit on screen was still within his grasp, if barely. His
eyes flitted around from diagram to diagram stitching together
a mental picture. Whatever this was that Frank was solving, it
wasn't immediately familiar. It took nearly an hour for the
mathematician to decypher the subject of the proof. Magnetism. It
was a small bit on the side of page 14 that tipped him off, where
power was being converted through magnetic induction. A grin
passed over him and he sat back in minor triumph. Sherlock
Trauffaut!

Nearby, the squeeking wheel had ceased its movement. No mops
splashed or footsteps fell, and even if they had the scientist at
his work wouldn't have noticed. His attention was fully engaged
upon a different mystery than the intrigue playing out around him.

No, Pierre-Jean didn't register any of this activity. He was
entirely focused on page 25 of the proof. Something struck
a memory, nearly understood but not quite connecting. Magnetism,
electricity, and other aspects of the electromagnetic spectrum
were all here. This was not just math, this was physics. This was
observable reality. That sly grin slipped back onto his face once
again. It was really happening.

Upstairs in a corner booth of a Pakistani restauraunt in Lisbon,
Spain, Darla Moss dipped the buttery garlic naan and scooped
a green dish into her mouth. She had ordered it by picture and
didn't know the name, but it was good, if a bit spicy. It only had
one chili pepper next to the picture on the menu, so she thought
it safe to her untrained midwestern palette. Across from her in
the booth sat a middle aged, dark-skinned man of uncertain
heritage. To look at him he could be a native of any country from
Portugal to India. Heavy black eyebrows gave him a serious look
that she knew to be all too accurate. He ate his food with
movements that looked practiced and at-ease. He knew what he was
doing. He belonged here. She, on the other handâ€¦

Darla checked her phone for the hundredth time in twenty minutes.
Once the message came this would all be over. She'd be on a plane
back home and Spain would be a distant memory. The man's dark eyes
danced up toward her and his spoon paused for the briefest of
moments before continuing. She felt his judgement and felt the
color flush her cheeks and neck before she could stop herself from
reacting.

Screw him, she thought. Her lips pressed into a line and she
purposfully held her phone out longer than necessary. Darla
considered flipping open a photo gallery or chat app to rub it in
his face, but she knew that was against protocol. This wasn't her
job. Of course she was nervous. It was natural. That didn't make
her an idiot, though. She could keep a low profile.
