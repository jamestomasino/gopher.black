                             "Untitled"

The cave was empty save the janitorial staff and the overnight
monitor. Pierre-Jean Trauffaut sipped a cola with an
unpronounceable nordic name and watched the logs slide by on
Frank's primary screen. Ever since the machine cleared the
bottlenecks things had gotten back to normal. Well, as normal as
can be for a monolithic quantum computer in an underground bunker.

Pierre-Jean's theory was playing out before him in real-time.
Algorithmic efficiency, the mathematical precursor to cognition.
It was here, right here, and it was working. He wasn't sure
exactly how the change would come about, but his proof was certain
it was going to happen. He felt it in his heart as well. Frank
would live, but it wouldn't be like the world expected. This was
no plaything imitating the human mind with its inconsistencies and
vagaries. Frank would emerge from pure mathematics itself. He
would be different. Better.

Pressing a button, he toggled the display between the general
overlay and selected one of the proofs Frank had marked as
optimal. The screen flashed from the black terminal into a bright
white matte of mathematical symbols. This was his work too, with
the help of Filip. The complex computations that Frank exported
were churned through his scripts and converted into this beautiful
human language. He could translate the mathematics in either
direction with a few keystrokes. One day, this is how they would
communicate with the machine. For now, though, he felt like he
were looking over Frank's shoulder and reading a diary.

This was a piece of its mind, a secret that with others compounded
to build Frank into what it was. A pure mathematical identity.

Pierre-Jean looked at the formulae spread out before him. The
display suggested that this proof was only 31 screens long. The
work that they'd been collecting was collectively over a trillion
paper pages in length already and it pained him to know he'd never
be able to read them all and understand. That was his limitation,
and that of all humans. Something new was needed to truly
comprehend everything.

He paged forward and the mathematics quickly transitioned from the
traditional forms he was experienced with and into the highly
specific quantum-level symbolic logic. Filip and he had argued for
many nights over how they would represent this new field. After
all, their own understanding was so basic and Frank was sure to
expand beyond them quickly. In the end they'd left the syntax
simple, deciding that brevity was less important than their
ability to figure out what was happening. Even with that decision
it was becoming increasingly difficult, though. There were only
a handful of people in the world who had sufficient training to
understand what was happening inside those boxes in the hazy
mists. Every day that list grew shorter as Frank increased in
complexity. When the time came that his work was unintelligible
then a new science would emerge for humans. Children being born
today would grow up in a world where there were answers to
questions we couldn't read instead of the other way around.

This bit was still within his grasp, if barely. His eyes flitted
around the screen from diagram to diagram stitching together
a mental picture. Whatever this was that Frank was solving, it
wasn't familiar. This must be a new barrier he ran into along the
way. Imagine that, he thought. Solving proofs could create new
problems to solve. He was now reading the answer to a question
that humans had never even thought to ask. His heart beat a little
bit faster.

It took nearly an hour for the mathematician to decypher the
subject of the proof. Magnetism. It was a small bit on the side of
page 14 that tipped him off, where power was being converted
through magnetic induction. A grin passed over him and he sat back
in minor triumph. Sherlock Trauffaut! With his new understanding
he dug further in. Somewhere in the background the squeaking wheel
of a soap bucket announced a janitor's presence. An air vent
overhead kicked on, adjusting to the small change in pressure and
heat that the extra body created. Inside a chamber cooled to just
above absolute zero, a microwave pulse triggered a coupling
resonator and the array of qubits was primed for a new
calculation. The processes chained across 612 individual qubits
and in a near instant the result passed out of the quantum core
and back into Frank's traditional systems for interpretation. The
microwaves continued their dance with the coupling resonators.

Pierre-Jean didn't register any of this activity. He was entirely
focused on page 25 of the proof. Something struck a memory, nearly
understood but not quite connecting. Magnetism, electricity, and
other aspects of the electromagnetic spectrum were all here. This
was not just math, this was physics. This was observable reality.
That sly grin slipped back onto his face once again. It was really
happening.

Somewhere along the way Frank had begun to comprehend his world.
How, though, was still a mystery. Vibudh had been adamant that
they would not design into Frank any sensor input. He was a being
of mathematics and logic; he was pure. But even with that
limitation, Pierre-Jean's calculations had predicted that the
machine would eventually find a way to theorize a world beyond the
math. The question and answer were in those trillions of pages
somewhere. They just had to look and understand.

It would take another 21 years before an undergraduate student in
Chennai would find the missing piece of that puzzle. She would
find the solution by accident, and it would lead to her only
published work.
