Darla was pissed. Right now she should be on a plane back to the
states with a cup of coffee in her hand. Instead, she was sitting
in a bare, concrete room at a metal table somewhere in Northern
Africa. This was not what she agreed to.

A hodgepodge of papers and notebooks spread across the table
illuminated by a solitary, naked bulb hanging overhead. The chair
was as hard as rock and her ass had gone numb.

She was pissed and someone was going to deal with it. That is,
just as soon as someone showed up. She'd been in this room for
hours--surely it must be hours by now--and no one had come by.
There were no sounds from the hallway, no sound at all in this
little bunker except her own pencil scratching notes while she
cursed and muttered.

She'd thought about walking out, storming back down the halls and
finding whoever was is charge. She'd spent a solid ten minutes
daydreaming about the hole she'd tear in whoeveritwas when she
found him. Oh, it would be a him, she was sure. This was
definitely the work of a gray-haired white guy. She would go off
on him with all the fire pent up inside and what could they do?
They needed her. Not a single person in the Agency could do what
she could do. They wouldn't risk going outside either. She was in
charge, she told herself. But she didn't try the door. She didn't
voice her fear, but somewhere deep inside she worried that the
door wouldn't open if she turned the handle. This place felt too
much like a cell already.

She stared at the papers again, the esoteric mathematics and
electronics spread across them with miniscule notes beside in
a careful hand. Motivation was sorely lacking, though. Do the job,
go home. That was the deal. She'd done the damn job, but this was
not home. This was nothing like her fucking home.

Darla didn't sigh. She was not the sighing type. Sighs were sounds
of resignation, defeat. They were for weak people who got pushed
around, not brilliant scientists who could change the world. Not
for top-tier spies who could destroy an enemy's nuclear program
with a bit of code and math. Darla would not sigh, damnit. Instead
she blinked back the moisture building in her eyes, took a deep
breath and screamed.

In the echoing silence that followed she was sure footsteps would
follow. Someone would check on her and she supposed she would be
expected to be embarrased, but that wasn't her either. She could
scream all she wanted. They had kidnapped her, after all. Her own
government had kidnapped her to some black site in the desert to
do the job she was already going to do for them. It made no sense,
and she was pissed.

Also, no one was coming. Not a sound from the hallway, not a sound
in her little cell besides herself.

The papers glared at her with a taunt. They just lay there with
their mysteries, serene. "You'll never understand me," they said.
"You're too stupid," she could almost hear them. "And fat, too."
This whole thing was fucked.

She definitely didn't sigh as she picked up her latest round of
notes and compared figures with one of the sheets. This was some
of the original work that the Stockholm team had put together. She
thought she had a handle on it all at first, following the
traditional patterns and principles of quantum computing design,
but then the changes started to show up. Where she'd expect to
find one thing she found the opposite, or nothing at all. This
design wasn't just a modification on what the NSA had in Utah,
this was something totally different. It wasn't the difference of
architecture alone, but of core concept. There were new quantum
theories at play here that she didn't know anything about, and
that was a real problem.

Darla Moss was a badass, brilliant scientist who worked for the
United States government. She was backed by unlimited funds and
the most powerful military in the world. She had all the tools at
her disposal--looking around, that part didn't feel true--and she
could summon the best help and minds in the world with the snap of
her fingers. So why did she feel so useless?

"You're not smart enough," the papers said.

"Fuck off," she said aloud to the room.

"You don't get it. You're never going to get it."

"FUCK!" she screamed again. Darla's cursing had never been very
creative. It was emotive, though. Frustration riled her faster
than anything else. It had been so since childhood. For
a brilliant little kid who understood new concepts the first time
they appeared in class, running into problems that blocked her
progress, that took perserverance, that really challenged her were
maddening. She wasn't prepared for that sort of thing. That's what
her therapist said. Things were too easy for her, so she never
developed the skills to deal with hard challenges.

Thinking back to her school days seemed to confirm that diagnosis.
She had projects that took time, but nothing she'd ever faced was
what she'd call difficult. Even in grad school, the proofs were
tedious, not hard. She knew solutions intuitively. The painful
process of writing everything down step-by-step, demonstrating the
logic, providing a clear path for others to follow, was not hard.
It was boring, but it was what was required, so she did it.

She thought of boot camp, then. That had been hard, she supposed.
It was grueling, physically exhausting. She was never much of an
athelete, and her dad had looked at her is such surprise when
she'd enlisted. He didn't get it. He didn't see the plan. Why not
office school? Why didn't she do it this way or that way. But he
never saw the patterns that she did. He didn't see the path she
was on though it was clear as day for her.

The Air Force had been hard, but not challenging. It had pushed
her endurance, grown her strength, challenged her willpower, but
not her intelligence. She knew what was coming next whether it was
a supposedly surprise inspection or an early morning wake-up for
training. She knew what they would test her on and how they would
assess her. That wasn't hard. Doing the work was just tiring.

The only time she'd had problems in the military were when the
others around her didn't see the pattern. A rosey afternoon with
a light breeze came back to her and collided with the memory of
pain and suffering. The military had many psychological techniques
to break a soldier down and build them up again. Group dynamics
were a huge part of it. Do not punish the individual, but rather
punish the group for the individual's actions. Let the group
demand compliance of its members itself. Force homogenity through
peer pressure. It was all basic psychology, but the group didn't
see it, even when she'd explained it again and again.

That hadn't earned her any friends either. They thought she was
aloof. They knew she thought herself smarter than the rest of
them, and even if the tests all agreed and her rate and position
agreed as well it didn't matter. That was the sort of rough spot
that needed to be smoothed out in the group. That was what needed
to be ground out.

That had been hard in its way, if not new. She'd always struggled
with friendships and group dynamics. Intelligence didn't behave
logically in a group. The individual's ability to see patterns and
truth could be right or wrong. The group could see right or wrong
and then overwhelm that choice through consensus. In a world where
most people were going to be wrong that meant the group would
choose the stupid thing more often than not.

This is why she didn't vote. This is why she didn't bother with
groups anymore. The Agency knew her worth. They let her do the
work alone and trusted her results because their own groups
couldn't get it done. The individual had a power that could
surpass any groupthink.

That thought hung in her mind like a splinter, poking her away
from revierie to the task at hand. She looked at the ordered
collection of qubit circutry, couplers, resonators, and saw
something new. It was just the beginning of an understanding, but
it worked. The pieces fit.

A machine had physical limitations. In the case of a quantum
machine, the number of qubits it could string together was the
heart of its power and its ability to reason. The more qubits, the
more power. It's the opposite of people, she thought. The bigger
the group, the stupider the result.

"But that's wrong, isn't it?" she didn't realize she was speaking
aloud. The camera mounted in the wall vent had escaped her notice
as well. Further down in the bunker a gray-haired white guy looked
up and smiled.

"She's got something," he announced to the room. Several others
swiveled in chairs. Everything was being recorded already, but the
extra attention in real time could make some difference. The
Agency didn't trust Darla Moss, after all. Her psychological
report had called her a loner and marked her high-risk for
subversive activity. They used her skills as an asset, but she
would never be one of them. She'd been labeled a troublemaker and
a headache to her superiors since the beginning. Depending on how
the next few minutes played out, she might not be a problem for
them for much longer.

Darla knew none of this, for all her reasoning capabilities and
astute observational skills. She was only an individual, and could
easily miss what others might see. She was blind in as many areas
as she was brilliant, after all. If she'd had close friends around
her, perhaps they might have noticed the way the Agency treated
her and warned her in some way. Perhaps if she'd had any sort of
group to rely upon their collective awareness might have steered
things differently. But she was only one woman, and she had many
flaws.

If she had been aware of the Agency's plan for her and the machine
it is unclear if that would have changed her behavior. She was
a creature true to her nature. The porcupine could hold back its
quills for a time, but they were always there. Eventually they
would prick, no matter how hard it tried to play nicely.

Darla's mind raced in full swing. A quantum state wasn't like
a person in the crowd and a string of qubits didn't behave like
a military unit. The individual still had sway, even if every
other bit said otherwise. This was no different than traditional
machines, and that was something she liked about them. What was
right was right. The machine got smarter with more processing
power, with more numbers, with a bigger crowd. The only upper
bounds were physical. How much memory or processing power could
you get in the space. How fast could the data be sent through the
system. The very speed of light was a limit on power.

"The speed of light," she muttered, and scribbled notes. She
crossed it out, removed it from calculations. Quantum rules were
differnet. quantum particles had special rules, special behaviors
that changed understanding. That's what made the quantum machines
special, more powerful. But those computations and that power was
based around a single properly of quantum mechanics.

"Superposition."

True, False, or both. Both is the superposition and it's the third
state that changed the rules for a machine. The small one in Utah
was built around that, and it used the same sort of mechanisms to
load and read
