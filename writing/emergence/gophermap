Emergence is a speculative fiction about the birth of artificial
intelligence. It follows the scientists and business men
responsible for the project, and eventually the machine itself as
computation becomes thought and thought becomes intelligence. It
asks questions about the nature of life, our place in the universe,
and ultimately good vs evil.
