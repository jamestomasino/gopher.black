I smiled sadly for a love long lost
to tears and wishes and dried up wells
and inside I felt a great wall crack
splitting side to farthest side
a dam flooded with torrent anew
from wellspring to memory.
I was lost inside the downpour,
my wretched grin burning my skin
leaving it dry, cracked and empty
while inside filling with brackish delight.

Breaking away the docks washed by
hurled into my sea of storms and
tore from me those lingering dreams
and anchors to the past.
Set adrift the touching the breathing
and perfumed hair of long gone winds
pulled along amidst the waves
to endless sky and endless sea.
On this shore buried deep
my feet and legs and torso drought
with fear or pain or numbness parched
for any small piece of rain to fall
or waves to splash or sweat to rise.
Waiting in vain for tears to call
when all had washed love long away.
