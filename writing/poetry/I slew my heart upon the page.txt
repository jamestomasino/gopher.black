I slew my heart upon the page
In red and black the ink was stained
Despite protest despite my rage
The pen to paper clearly maimed

Inside my mind inside my soul
A swirling torrent pulsing strong
Belittled harshly by this toll
Belittled, This it seems so wrong

I slew my heart upon the book
In red and black my blood was marred
Despite my rage the pen I took
And with a mark my soul was scarred.
