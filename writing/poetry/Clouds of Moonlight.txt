Clouds of Moonlight â€“ November 8, 2004

my plane rides between clouds lit on either side by moonlight,
the world has melted away into pictures of itself
moving by at the speed of sound, yet silent
like an old movie I can't quite understand.
I wait for the action to pause, for the cards to be revealed
for a narrator to tell me where I stand, where I should move
and to prompt me with lines to say when I am there.
