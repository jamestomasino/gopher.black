# Star Wars notes

## Prequels

- All alien dialog should be moved to subtitles and the sounds
  altered to sound like alien gibberish


## The Last Jedi

- Lightspeed crashes are too powerful

  - Should instead crash against First Order shields, spraying up
    material and creating a distracting cloud which hides the
    escape from enemies
  - If not, what are the limitations? Why wouldn't all engagements
    devolve to light speed kamikaze attacks. They could be droid
    initiated. Did they need to fight the Death Star or could they
    have just crashed a Corvette into it?

- Luke's character is wrong

  - His fear leading him to almost attack Kylo is at odds with his
    relationship with Darth Vader. He was more likely to error in
    "seeing the good"
  - A better focus would be on his failure to rebuild the Jedi
    leading him to the conclusion that the Jedi were wrong. The
    force needs balance.
  - His intercession via remote projection should not have been
    enough to kill him. It was a cheap way of writing him out.

- Rey should transition to the dark side and Kylo to the light

  - When Kylo saves Rey, the act should shock him into inaction
  - When Rey is saved, she should grab her light saber and be the
    one to kill the remaining guards. This would illustrate the
    beginnings of a switch between them. Show confusion and peace
    on his face and anger on hers.

- Snoke needs some explanation before he's removed from the story

  - Is he the emperor? He's a force user, so it seems like that's
    the only remaining option

- Captain Phasma didn't need a showdown with Finn

  - Finn shouldn't be able to take Phasma in a straight fight
  - There's no reason they should be pitted directly against one
    another. It felt forced.
  - Phasma deserved some proof of her awesomeness, but it could
    have been proven on a 3rd party fight, perhaps against the
    Rebel fleet as they're fleeing the First Order

- The First Order shouldn't be at a stalemate chasing the Rebels

  - Even if the rebel fleet is more maneuverable than the First
    Order capital ships, they have squadrons of fighters that
    should be actively chasing down the bigger ships, wearing them
    down.
  - The support craft should be under constant siege as they
    protect the leadership. We have one wave of attacks that takes
    out the bridge, nearly killing Leia, but they are then called
    off without good reason. The Empire doesn't value its troops.
    They have hordes and they are fighting the very last remnants
    of the rebellion. They should have every ship pouring after
    them, non-stop.
  - The opportunity for additional space battles gives the
    rebellion something to do during the chase instead of sitting
    around waiting for the gas to run out.
  - The ship battles provide an opportunity for boarding parties,
    which in turn could give Captain Phasma a chance to shine. Let
    her take out one of the smaller craft with or without aid.
  - When a rebel ship is lost, self-destruct it to take out as
    many of the harassing craft as possible, giving a respite to
    the fight and setting up a hint at the sacrifice to come with
    the light-speed crash.

- Balance to the Force

  - The prophecy that led the Jedi to Annakin Skywalker said that
    he would bring balance to the force, which he does by
    empowering the dark side to match the overwhelming light. This
    idea, that the force wants to maintain balance between light
    and dark, is a powerful angle that the newest trilogy should
    focus on:

    - Luke originally attempts to rebuild the Jedi order (skewing
      to the light). This fails when the dark side reasserts
      itself in Kylo Ren.
    - Kylo Ren & Supreme leader Snoke attempt to control all
      remaining Force power with the dark side. This fails when
      the light reasserts itself in Rey.
    - Luke's assessment that it's time for the Jedi to end is
      accurate
