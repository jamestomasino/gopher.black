On Magick and the forces of will
June 05th, 2018
----------------------------------------

christyotwisty [0] asked a question on Mastodon tonight:
[0] christyotwisty
    gopher://sdf.org/1/users/christyotwisty

  Those who use #magick to #manifest a material desire: what is it
  about the manifestation that tells you it's magick and not
  Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?

There's a lot to unpack in her request and I want to do it
justice, hence why the answer is happening here on gopher rather
than in a 500 character toot. 

I want to proceed logically. Taking to heart what Voltaire said,
"If you want to converse with me, first define your terms," I'll
attempt to do that now.


          ---------- Defining Terms ---------- 

[1] Magick
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Magick (Thelema)

The addition of the k to the end of magic has long been credited
to Aleister Crowley's Thelema to differentiate the occult practice
from stage magic and illusion. Since he coined the term I'll use
his definition here: "the Science and Art of causing Change to
occur in conformity with Will".

His definition was quite loose, and if you read his works you'll
see he uses the term interchangably to describe mundane acts, such
as like reaching out and picking up a pencil, along side ritual
magic which normally springs to mind. The idea that will can cause
any change in an object that it would be normally capable of in
nature is not surprising, then. With the right effort, anything
can be achieved. This line of thinking conflates and contrasts the
concepts of free will with destiny and leads to some... creative
conclusions.

For the purposes of this post I'm going to narrow Crowley's focus
into just his later category of occult action of will to affect
change. I suspect this is where christyotwisty was going with her
question. As we proceed I'll try to further narrow this definition
and cross-reference it with other, similar concepts.


Frequency illusion

As defined on Wikipedia's list of cognative biases: "The illusion
in which a word, a name, or other thing that has recently come to
one's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency
shortly afterwards (not to be confused with the recency illusion
or selection bias). This illusion is sometimes referred to as the
Baader-Meinhof phenomenon."

In addition to this specific illusion bias, I'll also try to
address synchronicity and confirmation bias. There's really a host
of mental phenomena which are all interrelated in the context of
the question.


       ---------- Subject-matter clarification  ----------

Before addressing the question directly I think I should say
a word or two about the subject of magick itself. There is
a strong divide between groups of people who entertain the idea of
magick as a serious phenomenon and those who dismiss it as
childish delusion. All too often, the former group is then
stigmatized and preconceived prejudices run wild, which
unfortunately make serious discussion all but impossible.

I want to disuade that behavior by stretching the concept of
magick to include similar practices that fall under more widely
acceptable terminology. Remembering our core definition of
magick--the use of will via occult (or paranormal) means to affect
change--we can find many common practices that fit the mold.

From the East:
[2] Qigong
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Qigong
[3] Tai Chi
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Tai Chi

The entire system of Chinese medicine falls into this category,
manipulating unseen energies through will and the use of natural
actions, herbs, and meditation. Falun Gong, Prana, Tao Yin and so
on also fit.

From the West:
[4] Laying on of hands
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Laying on of hands
[5] Exercism
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Exercism
[6] Hypnosis
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Hypnosis

In the west there are many religious practices deeply rooted in
Christianity which clearly fit the definition of magick we're
using. Between the extremes of popular religious rites and the
ridiculed parlor ritual there is a whole range of activity. Yoga,
reiki, mindfullness medititation, and good old basic prayer all
seek to affect some sort of change through the focus of primarily
mental expressions of will.

As you can see, the question here is not limited to casting spells
in a circle under a full moon. You could reasonably reword
christyotwisty's question:

  Those who pray for change: what tells you it's working and not
  just your mind playing a trick on you?


         ---------- Efficacy of Magick ---------- 

[7] Efficacy of Prayer
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Efficacy of prayer

Using the framework we've established, we can use the more
mainstream magickal practices to explore the scientific
investigations of occult phenomena. In the link above, there is
a wealth of information about the difficulties in statistical
inference and falsifiablity, measurability in general, and
a survey of the types of studies that have been done. I'd strongly
recommend reading that page cover-to-cover with an open mind.

The most striking thing to me about the challenges of study and
the measurability of outcomes is that we must take a sacred
activity and measure it by elements that are profane (to use the
terms of Mircea Elliade). Ultimately the change that should occur
is a profane one, though. It must be concerned with the material
world or else we're using our mind to change our mind, which
doesn't seem to fit our narrow definition of magick. Perhaps using
your mind to change the mind of another could fit, but the method
would be the key deliniation (batting your eyes and winking can
certainly create new thoughts in someone else but is that
magick?).

If our outcomes are limited to the physical then they are
measurable. What comes next is to determine what action of will
can create these effects at a significant rate above a control.
This is a very rigorous way to avoid issues of the Baader-Meinhof
phenomenon or other cognative biases.

So what do studies of that have to say? From the article above,
a "systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive
results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had 'small, but significant,
effect sizes' but the review noted that the three most
methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant
findings". Overall, there's just not a lot of rigorous research
being done. Even if we did have reliable results, prayer
represents only a small fraction of the occult magickal practices
in the world, and prayer itself has thousands of forms and formats
to consider.

So where do we go from there? Let me start by pointing out that
after thousands of years of advancement and the advent of western
medicine, the Chinese still widely practice their traditional
medicine. That alone speaks to its efficacy. The west is bringing
over learnings from China every day.

And that brings me to my next point: occult practices are occult
because they are unknown. The paranormal describes things outside
of normal experience. Occult practices once included metalurgy.
What we don't fully understand is often ignored and denegrated
rather than explored and investigated. There is a staggering
amount of knowledge we have confirmed through science only
hundreds of years of casual practice. As an example, the entire
field of optics existed and flourished for centuries before we
understood the science of shaping glass.

Our understanding of the effects may be limited, but out
understanding of the method is almost completely absent. In one of
the prayer studies there was no significance in those prayed for
vs those not, but there was a lift in those that knew they were
being prayed for. Perhaps when it comes to immune responses we
have a greater power to manipulate the physical in ourselves than
in others through will alone. Perhaps this one of the infinite
varieties of action wasn't the specific one needed.


         ---------- Narrowing the Scope ---------- 
          
Has any of this answered christyotwisty's pertenant question? Not
quite yet. Let's reiterate in case you've forgotten where we're
aiming with all this:

  Those who use #magick to #manifest a material desire: what is it
  about the manifestation that tells you it's magick and not
  Baader-Meinhof phenomenon?

The question does not question that a manifestation has taken
place, but instead seeks to understand how you can confidently
credit it to the magickal act rather than any number of cognative
biases or coincidence. To properly answer this I have to point to
three seminal works in religious study:

The Idea of the Holy (Das Heilige) by Rudolf Otto published in the
early 20th century. It has never gone out of print and it has been
absolutely instrumental in the development of comparative religion
as a field of scholarly study. 

The Sacred and the Profane by Mircea Elliade, who I referenced
earlier. Elliade takes up the mantle that Otto laid down and takes
it to the next level. Notably, he discusses how the myths and
stories of a people lead to the creation of their symbols. Those
symbols lead to an experience of hierophany, or a breaking through
of the profane world to glimpse the Sacred and its Mysterium
Tremendum, to feel fascinated, terrified, and infinitely the
"creature" in the midst of creation. This relationship through
culture and symbols to find a common experience of the Sacred
crosses all known boundaries and shares almost identical patterns
in the Eastern Orthodox Church as it does in Aboriginal tribes of
Australia or the Lenape Indians in America.

The Varieties of Religious Experience by William James. This was
a book written from James' lectures in Scotland on the various
types of personal expressions of religious understanding. There
are many, many ways that people relate to the divine or the
Sacred, even if they consider that Sacred an unconscious power and
not a diety. Those experiences have many things in common and fit
into categories that allow for discussion of the experience
without having to dwell on the truth of that experience.

Taken together these books tell a story without a narrative. It is
the story of a people, of all people, and our relationship to
powers beyond our conceptualization that we yearn for in a million
ways and experience in glimpses between breaths. The truth of the
stories that lead to these experiences is not as important as the
fact that we all reach the same experiences once we get there. The
symbols change, but that moment of connection with the divine is
a spark of Truth that rings inside us and overwhelms doubt.

Christy, you ask how you know whether your manifestation comes
from magick. The science is still out, but the experience is
redily accessible. Choose your own pathway and look for the Truth
that resonates deep inside your spirit. Ultimately the confidence
that something comes from a magickal place will come from an
understanding that something has happened that is beyond the
normal world and has pierced that layer separatating the Sacred.
There is a feeling in it that can be communicated and shared.

Ask a priest how they heard the call and watch for that smile.
That's how you know.

Git

There's some panic in the air over Microsoft courting Github.
Alarmists are pulling their projects down, moving to self-hosted
Gitlab instances and so on. I'm confused by the whole thing,
though. Git isn't github. My repos aren't property of github, even
if it's one of the remotes. I have everything up there mirrored in
several remote locations. That's the beauty of git! It's
distributed. Every repo is the complete repo.

orbifx summarized it best over here [0].
[0] Decentralised Git
    gopher://notes.orbitalfox.eu/0/note/15ec76d8-a67c-4c19-abc4-103184760186

This gopher hole is a great example. It's currently located:
- on this laptop I'm writing on
- on gopher.black (raspberry pi)
- on SDF
- on Tilde.town
- on bitbucket.org
- on my macbook air at work
- on a backup tower at work
- on my PC in a VM in VirtualBox
- and probably some other places I forgot about

I think the lesson here for people shouldn't be to fear Microsoft
nabbing Github. The lesson should be, distribute your shit,
people! Use git for awesome.

----------------------------------------

Mastodon is having a little tiff right now over the introduction
of a new feature: trending hashtags. As the project maintainer
puts it, it has been the most requested feature addition for over
a year. When it rolled out, though, it was met with widespread
criticism and, in many cases, open hostility. The rebuttals back
and forth quickly escalated and became personal. Pretty much
everyone involved is greatly unhappy, regardless of their position
on the issue.

Meanwhile, I'm sitting back here thinking to myself, "democracy in
action." A collective developed and idea with their voices (the
addition of trending hashtags). When that idea was implemented,
other collectives disagreed. They weren't aware of its
development, they argue. It is unsafe and can be used for evil. It
will target groups who are often targets and make Mastodon unsafe
or unwelcoming.

There's one person in charge of the project. He must be the
problem. If it weren't for him, surely the issue would be put to
rest. It's as simple as that, because a "pure" democracy will
always work things out. This is an example of corruption of the
perfect, federated state.

Sound familiar? Yeah, I thought so. The issue isn't having
a single leader. The issue is that groups of people have different
wants and needs. This is inherent to any sized group of people
greater than one. You cannot make them all equally happy. You
cannot serve every single use case simultaneously. The utopia of
democracy does not exist, just as it does not exist for communism,
or socialism, or even monarchy.

So what do we do? We use our brains. We make decisions that help
as many as we can. We use our morals and make decisions that hurt
as few as possible. We don't cross lines that shouldn't be
crossed. We listen to the words of the suffering and try to ease
that suffering. We say to those with excess, "you have excess.
Your priorities are lower than those who need help."

This is all but impossible in systems that favor group-think. The
power in those systems comes from those who can manipulate the
system. Who can speak loudest is often the one with the most
money. The wider the spread of power, the more this systematic
influence becomes absolute. It can devolve to cult of personality
eventually. The key to the recipe is broad reach of voice.

What is the countermeasure? Strong-willed leaders who can champion
the "right" decisions. What makes those decisions right? The
things I listed above. What ensures a leader will execute those
decisions and not others? That depends on your system. In
government, there's not much, though a constitutional system can
help balance it. It's easy to slide into despotism. In social
systems like open source projects, the answer is the freedom to
move on. The system is open source and the protocol can work with
other projects. Mastodon can be forked and formed into something
else by others with a different set of principles. If the current
leader of the project does not implement policy (in the form of
software features) that reflects the needs of the people, that's
the easiest path to take. No bloodshed, just moving on and
building something new.

But back to the question of trending hashtags themselves. Are they
a good idea? Probably not, at least in the way they've been
implemented so far. There's been a lot of valid points about how
bad actors already abuse similar systems in other networks.
There's nothing currently in place to prevent that, and the
distributed nature of the network makes stopping those attacks
even harder than on Twitter. There have been very good ideas to
tweak the feature to avoid the abuse. Ultimately it should come
down to a cost/benefit analysis. Unfortunately it's more likely to
come down to the loudest screamers. But that's democracy.

Bicycles
June 02nd, 2018
----------------------------------------

I posted a picture of my bicycle over on Mastodon. As I mentioned
there, I have no real background with bikes beyond riding one as
a kid. I bought an old racer off a guy in college and that's been
my bike for most of my adult life. It was seriously uncomfortable.
The seat was like a spear into my butt and I sat completely folded
in half. The bike was really light weight, but that doesn't matter
if you are sitting on top of it.

A few years back I decided that I deserved a more comfortable
bike. I went to the shop in town and told them I wanted to sit
upright and have a squishy seat. They found me a great bike that
I tested out. It was so much better than my old one. The frame
says "Specialized", or something like it. It might be the brand or
the model. I have no idea. It's a 7 speed thing and easy to shift
with a twist of the right handle. It mostly doesn't hurt me to
ride it, and that's a plus.

So, all you bike nerds, what can you tell me about my bike? Is it
a decent thing? Is there a reason my hands still go numb when
I ride more than a few miles? Any advice for making biking suck
less (I still prefer walking).

  <title>Cli Tricks Track</title>

CLI Tricks: track
May 31st, 2018
----------------------------------------

This is a part of a series of phlog entries where I will share
some of my command line tricks, tips, and scripts.


## track ##

Fitness trackers are all the rage. Chances are that you've got one
on you right now, weirdo. Collecting data about your own behavior
is pretty neat. It's extra cool if you can do it in a way that
doesn't also give that data away to nefarious strangers who want
to take over the world, but I digress.

I like tracking my shiz too. I've used my phone to count steps in
the past, and I have a scale in my bathroom, and a tape-measure
for my big belly. But where do I save those numbers so I can look
back on my amazing progress of awesomeness later? I don't really
want to hand that over to Google or MyFitnessPal. They don't need
to know that stuff. I could just store it in text files for myself
and parse them later.

And that's exactly what I decided to do. I keep some csv files in
dropbox, or in nextcloud, or in syncthing. But logging stuff in
CSV files isn't really fun, so I wrote a little tracker app to
help me out.

Now you can enjoy the glory of my crappy little program too!
First, grab a copy over on github [0] and install it.

[0] track
    http://github.com/jamestomasino/track

It's really easy to use. Start by checking the man page or
spitting out some help:

  $ man track

  $ track -h

See how to use it? Great! You're done!

But seriously, it is really basic. You can just add a new metric
to track by tracking something to it for the first time. It allows
only one data point per day. It doesn't care what format that data
is in.

There's probably easy ways to break it, so, um, don't do those.

Do you have something you want to add to it to make it better?
Cool! Make a pull request and gimme-gimme. I probably want that
feature too.

Oh, as a side-note, the data I used in my post "Fat" [1] all was
logged with this script. I have an example in that post of how to
generate a graph on the command line using the jp utility. Check
it out.

[1] Fat
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180407-fat

Now that track is a bit more sophisticated, I can track my weight
by typing:

  $ track -ac weight | jp -input csv -width 67 -height 25

A bit of an improvement!

  <title>Tracking As Stalking</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/0/phlog/./20180527-tracking-as-stalking/gophermap</link>

  <description><![CDATA[<pre>

Tracking as Stalking
May 27th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Stalking - 

"criminal activity consisting of the repeated following and
harassing of another person."

"a course of conduct directed at a specific person that involves
repeated (two or more occasions) visual or physical proximity,
nonconsensual communication, or verbal, written, or implied
threats, or a combination thereof, that would cause a reasonable
person fear."

There is an argument made by those practicing large-scale data
capture and aggregation of individuals that the data they collect
is public information, and therefore it is legal and justified.
Even if the information collected was indeed all public--and I do
not agree to that line of argument at all--then the question is
still not settled. The very act of repeated visual proximity
(which is transferrable to digital media via cyber-stalking
definitions) which could cause a "reasonable person fear" falls
clearly within the bounds of stalking. If it is a corporation
commiting these acts, then it is no less culpable than if it were
an individual. After all, corporations are people too, right? [0]

[0] Corporate personhood (Gopherpedia)
    gopher://gopherpedia.com/0/Corporate personhood

The act of data aggregation of an individual carries with it the
inherent threat of what is being done with that data. As more
revelations are brought to light informing the public of the
deeply unsettling targeting of individuals for political
manipulation, commercial activation, or social harassment, the
fear increases. What else could be done with that information?
Even if nothing is actually put into motion, the act of
collection, of monitoring, is in itself a form of digital stalking
that explicitly undermines the argument of "public information".

Anonymous collection of data into aggregate data sets that cannot
be retargeted or focused to communicate outbound with a specific
population or person is still problematic. If that data allows you
to segment or infer the actions of a type of person or group,
especially one that routinely faces subjugation or discrimination,
then the act of collection contributes to a justifiable fear of
persecution. It is stalking.

The counter argument to all of these points is that the underlying
economic power of the internet is governed and supplied by data
collection. It is a capitalist requirement that some sort of
economic incentive be present to promote the growth and stability
of the systems. Money talks, or so the argument goes. How can we
cut out advertising and still have nice things? Will everything
need to become a paid subscription?

Here's the thing: there is no inherent, inaliable rights to
Netflix. Facebook is not a universal, precious entity that
deserves the protection and preservation of all people. The only
thing that fits that category is the people themselves. If
protecting individuals and groups of people damages these systems,
then that is the path that should be followed. If those systems
can find an alternative, legal way to continue their operations
then kudos to them. There is no argument that should value the
continued operation of a social network over the safety of even
a single individual. 

Money talks in capitalism, but capitalism cannot be allowed to run
unchecked. The morality of all people must pull on those reins and
keep careful watch. Systems of governance cannot become
subservient to the interests of economic forces over those of
moral obligation. Any systems of governance that allow this will
ultimately fail. First they will fail their people, and eventually
they will fail completely, often with dire consequences to both
those in power and those oppressed by it.

Data collection is a simple thing. It's easy to watch tracking
events fire and show up in pretty graphs. It's easy to use this to
optimize your experiences, improve them, make the user's day
a little easier. It's easy to look at the rosy garden that casual
analytics presents and see only the flowers. Just like
capitalism's promise of innovation through financial competition,
the premise is beautiful on the surface. Left unchecked it will
corrupt. That corruption will consolodate power and influence.
That power and influence will allocate more benefit to the few in
charge at the cost of the masses. The flowers are not worth it.

Move your feet

It's been a while since my last phlog*. I've been wanting to get
back on gopher and do some serious plain text awesomeness, or at
least comment on the really cool happenings around the space. Cat,
love your diet, tell me more! How are you and your partner going
to handle it when you go back down under? Sparkipx, how's Felix
holding up now that you've been able to ride for a couple weeks?
Is it harder to do long distances on a folding bike than
a non-folding one? I've never tried one before. jynx, I'm totally
fascinated by single player RPGs and I need to go back through and
read up on your stuff. Tabletop role-playing is my #1 activity of
awesome, and that sounds stellar. horsemans has a cool gopher
wishlist that you guys should check out. I bet you can offer a lot
of responses there. [0]

Several of you are on vacation or soon returning. Welcome back and
all that. I hope you'll share insights and adventures. I love
travel stories so much. Hell, I love STORIES so much. tfurrows,
I'll be checking out Variations soon! Oh, and I have a Fiskers
push-mower and it's badass. I have to use it twice a week or the
grass grows too long for it to be effective. That part sucks. But
if you have a really small lawn, it's so nice to be able to handle
it quietly and "naturally".

Recently I've been absorbed in a string of poor projects at work
that have been eating up my mental energies. The work isn't hard,
but the clients have been difficult. I've been avoiding
unnecessary computer time as a way of disconnecting. Marry that up
with some unexpected (but welcome) consulting work, and my time
became even more short. Mostly, though, the thing that's kept me
away is a rededication to that principle I mentioned in recent
posts, deliberate practice.

I've been working on my shakuhachi quite a bit, and even met with
my kali instructor in the park at the side of a lake for
a fantastic jam in the rain. He built me a new shakuhachi, which
is just fantastic. It's a 1.9 (slightly deeper sound than the
standard 1.8) jin nashi flute and it's absolutely perfect. I'll be
sewing a new case for it soon, and an extra for him as well in
thanks.

I've also been walking a shit-ton. Every morning I wake at 6:35
and head outside to walk 2 to 2.5 miles on the canal towpath that
is the road I live on. Each evening, after putting my son to bed,
I head back outside and do another 2 miles. Sometimes I zip around
the neighborhood for a change of scenery. Sometimes I head into
town and walk the sidewalks. Most often I stay next to the canal
where I know the landscape features that mark my distance by
heart. I pop headphones in and binge audiobooks while I'm out
there. It's heaven.

Walking is a "keystone habit" for me, a term I learned from that
book on Habits with the yellow cover that I can't remember the
name of. When I walk, I do other good things as well. I eat well,
I sleep well, I think clearly. If I don't walk, holding on to the
other things is more difficult. So, walking rocks!

Hopefully I'll have more to share soon. In the meantime, I need to
go for a walk.

* I have a pet peeve about when people waste time in blogs and
phlogs talking about how they haven't posted in a long time.
That's the nature of the medium and the repetitive act of
explaining or apologizing for it serves no purpose except to make
you self-conscious. Now here I am doing it myself. Stupid.

More updates

That's a little depressing. After 11 days away I just wrote a long
update that is substantively the same thing I wrote 11 days ago.
I feel the need to amend this with some additional updates:

FBI File [0] - I received my FBI results. There are no records of
me in their files. I could follow up and request further research
looking for me in cross-references, but I think I'm good enough
with what I got. I'm still waiting for replies from the other
intel orgs.

Poison Sumac [1] - It's finally gone. Holy shit that took a long
time.

The Hobbit [2] - The boy is loving it. We haven't gotten to read
it every night, but he's so excited about what's coming (I gave
hints). He talks about Smaug all the time despite having not met
him yet. He's excited for the giant spiders because I have
horrible arachnophobia and he thinks that's funny. We're just
leaving Rivendell and the Last Homely House. I can't wait for
Gollum!

Finally, I've been brainstorming some ideas and getting some good
feedback from mastodon folks about a talk I want to present at
Barcamp Philly this year. I'll get it all ready to go and
hopefully it'll be something people want to attend. If not, I'll
record it and keep it ready for 1436CON/Port 70 [3].

[3] Port 70 -or- 1436CON

Practice updates
May 11th, 2018
----------------------------------------

It's good to celebrate small victories. This week has been full of
them. I've kept up with my goal of deliberate practice regarding
writing, playing music, and even exercise. It feels great to be on
track. The next challenge will be to keep it going through the ups
and downs and boring times.

Regarding exercise, I'm well back into ketosis again (thank God)
and I've ramped up my walking. I'm walking two miles in the
morning and again in the evening. That's long been my foundation
or keystone habit to hold everything together and it seems to be
working again. I have been eating well and not snacking. The focus
has helped with my practice. All is well!
