Oops!
October 01st, 2018
----------------------------------------

You might not be reading this right now unless you are checking
out one of my mirrors on SDF.org or tilde.town. That's because
I accidentally blew up gopher.black. OHNOES!

I was getting annoyed at the buzzing from the fan on my pi's case.
I opened it up and tried spraying it with a little lubricant, but
it didn't make a difference in the sound. So, what the hell, I'll
just pull it out. Unfortunately, in the process my jostling of the
SD card put it into read-only mode and now nothing works.

Since the card is still readable I'm dding it down to a backup.
I've got a new SD card ordered from Amazon and it should be here
by Wednesday. I'll restore, plug that bad-boy in, and hopefully
everything will be right as rain. If not, I've got 3 extra
raspberry pi's lying around that can happily become the next
gopher.black. I've got the data, I've got redundant hardware. This
shouldn't be too bad.

Still... derp.

  <title>Sdf Gopher Servers</title>

sdf gopher servers
September 29th, 2018
----------------------------------------

As many of you are aware, sdf.org recently performed some
upgrading which somehow disrupted their gopher servers. As
a result, everything reverted to being run off bucktooth instead
of gophernicus. After a bunch of prodding on bboard, sdf.org was
reverted to gophernicus, but a very out-of-date version.
Gopher.club, the preferred DNS mirror of SDF for gopher according
to its tutorials, is still left using bucktooth.

There's a few painful parts to this. A few of the more active
gopher users hosting on SDF were actively using the cgi script
features of gophernicus which were not a part of bucktooth's
offering. As a result, some of their gopher holes failed to load
at all, or loaded incorrectly. Second, the constant changes in
server info means that our aggregators keep triggering as if
everyone on SDF posted new content. I know this has been
a challenge for logout [0] whose Bongusta! [1] aggregator has been
affected. It's also affected my moku-pona listings [2]. 

As a result, for the time being I have reverted all SDF
gopherholes to using the sdf.org domain instead of gopher.club in
my listings. This way they will display correctly at least. Sadly,
gophernicus outputs server information in a footer of gophermaps,
so it will likely continue to trigger the mass-update phenomenon
whenever NetBSD or gophernicus itself are updated. I think we've
all learned to work around this by now, though.

Finally, I've posted about all this on the sdf.org bboard in
a single requests post. I'm hopeful that seeing it all clearly
outlined will help the admins update gophernicus to the latest
version and get gopher.club back in line. Time will tell! If you
continue to see mass-updates on the aggregators I apologize, but
there's limited control unless I go through manually to clean
everything up each time (like logout does). It'll settle down
eventually.

  <title>Enforced Anonymity</title>

Enforced anonymity
September 24th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Gopher has been filled with threads on the topic of anonymity [0],
but I want to take a different tack. There's a storm brewing in
the form of Codes of Conduct for online communities. I have
OPINIONS on these things, and the only appropriate place for
opinion on the internet is hidden in dead protocols.

Codes of Conduct attempt to accomplish a GOOD. They attempt to
ensure that individuals are not exposed to unfair prejudice. This
is a movement toward equality, which it itself is also a GOOD. (I
have argued in the past that I prefer liberty over equality, but
that is not a comparison of good vs bad, but rather a personal
stance on which is a greater good.) So far, we're all good here.

Codes of Conduct are also weapons. They are wielded by the
oppressed and marginalized with a powerful blow aimed at those
they feel have transgressed. Is this a GOOD? Providing
a reciprocal power dynamic is an expression of vengeance, not of
justice. It does not guarantee liberty or equality. It guarantees
a shifted power-base and a new set of mores to be navigated, or
else. This is not good. This is bad.

Hold off on the pitchforks. Go re-read the second paragraph again
if you're getting steamy at me.

If you're sitting there feeling like a Code of Conduct is a vital
tool in your arsenal as an objectified person, a minority, or
other disenfranchised group member, I can totally understand why.
It's good to not be shit upon or taken advantage of. But at the
same time, role reversal perpetuates a never-ending cycle of
anger. "It's our turn," is the voice of a failed morality. It may
feel good, but it gives no high ground and it leads to more
suffering for more people.

(I'm skirting around going into some deeper ethics talk on the one
hand, or going off into sci-fi territory and making a bunch of
Dune parallels, but I'm going to leave it alone and get to the
point instead).

"So what, tomasino? If Codes of Conduct aren't the answer, what do
you think we should do?"

Thanks for asking! First, I don't believe it is a necessity for
a criticism to offer an alternative solution. It is okay to point
out that something is wrong but not have a better alternative
prepared. And guess what? I don't! I have a ridiculous alternative
that we most definitely SHOULD NOT DO. I'm going to share it with
you as a thought exercise.

Here's my idea: 100% enforcement of anonymity. Boom! Meritocracy
blind to identity politics can only be 100% guaranteed if there is
no identity to politic. Go ahead and create your company, your
online group. Share your code, grab commits and share and merge
and whatever else technocrats do. But... no signatures. No names.
No personal sharing. You want an online identity, grab a number,
or we'll pull a string of dictionary words and assign them to you.

Now everyone is safe, has an equal voice and can be judged by
their own contributions. You want a code of conduct in the mix?
I got you covered. It's got 2 rules:

1) If you share your identity, or provide information that
   establishes a personal identity with the community, you're out.
2) If you share another person's identity or personal details
   about them, you're out.

This magical, mystical utopia actually sounds good to some people,
I'm sure. But it's not. It overlooks the beauty of human
interactions and the infinite possibilities for the advancement of
our species. It's an act of fear. Don't do it. Seriously, please
don't do it. Also, cool it with the Codes of Conduct. Protect
people, don't burn them.

And yes, Linus is an ass.


[0] I was really going to go look these up, but then I got
distracted. Take my word for it. There were a lot of posts on the
subject earlier this year.

burrow 1.7.1
September 24th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Wow, so that was a big change. I was annoyed with some of my code
in burrow so I did a bit of surgery and blew up some features and
made some more generalized helpers instead.

burrow recipe
burrow topic
burrow create-config
GONE!

burrow edit-config will generate a new config for you if you don't
already have one. I've also added a new super-powerful command
called:

burrow gophermap

Enter that and hit enter and it'll open your root gophermap. But
that's not all!!! Hit tab after that bad-boy...

burrow gophermap <tab>

It'll list all your directories and any gophermaps you've got. You
can crawl your way through with more tab completion. You don't
need to be in your gopher directory for it either. It'll figure it
all out! :D

Once you hit enter it'll strip out "i" types and tabs and server
info from your gophermap temporarily so you can edit it. Once you
save it again it'll add all the fancy codes back in place. Open up
a new filename that you make up on the spot to create a new
gophermap. It'll default to no title, but you can fill in that
bit.

burrow phlog # still exists

Neat stuff. Pull, make, make install

aNONradio show
September 07th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Yesterday cat posted on Mastodon that someone should jump on
openVOIP and monologue. That sounded like a great idea and
I wasn't busy, so I decided I'd go for it. My first thought was
that I'd read some Virgil or maybe Bronte. I walked into my dining
room which has the main collection of our books and looked over my
shelves for something good. Boy Scout Handbook... Nimzowitsch...
Harry Potter in Latin... ahh, here we are:

ZORK #4: Conquest at Quendor

Is there a more perfect book for the SDF crew than a choose your
own adventure ZORK? I snapped a quick picture of the cover and
posted it to mastodon, then walked upstairs to my office. A note
on IRC or two and I was dialing in to the openVOIP line. At first
there was some sort of text adventure being played out with
Daniel's robot voice narrating it. That wrapped up and I got
started.

It was awkward, silly, and entirely too much fun. Instead of
picking the choices in the book myself I tossed them out to the
crowd to chime in. The engagement from people in com, mastodon,
and IRC made the experience for me. I was riding a high afterwards
and talked myself into doing it again. This time, though, I'll do
it right.

The anonradio mailing list folks agreed that the show was worthy
of a time slot, so now on Thursday nights/Friday mornings at 0100
UTC, or 9PM EST, I'll be continuing our adventures. This first
"real" show I'll finish up the ZORK story so I don't leave
everyone hanging, and then we'll start a new adventure. I don't
know that I'll make a point of finishing the adventures or not. If
time runs out I may just start a new one the next week instead of
trying to pick up again. On the one hand, it's nice to have some
completion, but these are books designed to be tried again and
again. Also, the authors aren't getting paid for this beyond me
buying a book or two, so I like the idea of enticing people with
the show so that they might go out and pick up a copy if they
enjoy it. That makes the whole thing seem much more legit, right?

To support the new show I've added a new section to my gopher
hole. You can find it on the root gophermap and here: 
Choose Your Own Adventure (anonradio)
    gopher://gopher.black/1/cyoa

For those who want to check it out, details about the first real
episode can be found here:
Episode 001 (2018-09-14)
    gopher://gopher.black/0/cyoa/2018-09-14-episode-001.txt

Please join me next week for the first show!

Blogging
September 04th, 2018
----------------------------------------

So I just published a regular old boring blog post and now I feel
dirty. I mean, not really, but I do feel something. I think it's
frustration or annoyance. You see, I wanted to open the blog with
a screenplay style intro, but it turned out to be painfully
difficult. I'm using Hugo which in turn uses markdown for
formatting and generally that's just fine. But in this case
I wanted to do some very specific text formatting that would have
been obvious and immediate in gopher but which took me five or six
iterations to figure out over there.

But it has a picture! :/ Meh, I guess so. More-over, the content
fit the theme of another blog post I wrote about Clue (this one is
about Guess Who, btw). It made sense to put it on the web.

I guess it once again illustrates why I prefer gopher. I can just
write stuff here and I'm done. In the world of HTTP I need to
massage stuff, play with themes, etc. Moops to that.

  <title>3d Printing</title>

3D Printing
September 01st, 2018
----------------------------------------

I bought a 3D printer. It's a FlashForge Finder, available on
Amazon for somewhere in the $300-350USD range at present. It
prints PLA but not ABS, has a decent sized print area, comes fully
assembled, and has fair community support. The service that
FlashForge offers is extremely responsive and helpful. Overall I'm
quite pleased with the purchase.

Since Tuesday I've been printing things almost non-stop. I've made
an external spool holder to support bigger filament spools than
the printer can handle normally. I've got a tool holder caddy on
the box as well. I've made an Arduino Uno bumper/baseplate, a few
toys for my son including squishy turtles and a fully articulated
snail with shell that opens. As I'm writing this a book holder
just finished.

I'll be making some desk accessories soon, and then I think I'll
take my first stab at designing my own piece by modifying the
hanging tool-holder to make a glue-stick holder of the same style.

3D printing is pretty fantastic. It's really easy, way faster than
I expected, and the quality of this personally affordable model is
suprisingly good. I can make real things!

Oh, I made a few rings for my wife. She's allergic to metal, so
this is perfect. I've sanded them down and I'm priming them now.
Later today I'll paint and seal them for her. Isn't that exciting?
I can design her jewelry, print it, post-process, and she can wear
it all in the same day. That's some agrestic shit right there [0].

  <title>Letterboxing</title>

Letterboxing
August 31st, 2018
----------------------------------------

Let me preface this by saying my snark here is entirely fictional
and I have the greatest of respect for other people's hobbies...

                *    *    *    *    *    *    
                
Geocaching is bullshit. Seriously? Let me poke in some numbers and
walk there and boom! a seeeeeecret thing. Tada! (play "Link gets
the triforce noise" in your head). Oh sure, there's clues to solve
but at the end of the day the whole physical aspect of going
somewhere could be removed and replaced with a checkbox that says,
"Yep, got it."

Now letterboxing... that's the shit right there. None of this
fancy schmancy technology. Instead, good old fashioned vague
pioneer directions like, "Go west-north-west for 45 paces until
you near the tree that looks like an old man taking a piss."
That's some real adventure! Not the old man taking a piss, the
dire--you know what I mean. I love letterboxing. I will stamp the
shit out of some letterboxes. I will leave hitchhikers along the
way and have grand adventures in state parks. Mmmm, saucy hobby.

The reason I bring this up is not to bash geocaching (though that
was fun) but because Christy (who loves her some GPS) reminded me
of an idea I had a while back for letterboxing which, I suppose,
could be channelled for the dark arts in her hobby as well. My
idea was to make a series of box challenges which led from one to
the other and eventually were all pieced together into an Uber
challenge. Not the car service kind, but like--you know what
I mean.

The theme was cryptography, which I felt was fitting. The simplest
box used a Da Vinci cipher. The box then gave a piece of the
puzzle to the next clue which was an Arnold cipher. Then on to
a straddling checkerboard. Then the big one was a VIC cipher. And
when you took the pieces from all the boxes together and
concatenated all the strings you found, it would be a PGP key you
could use to decode the final message to the final box.

I got as far as that and some basic clue planning, then I got hung
up on where I wanted to hide the boxes and never got around to
doing it. So, if you are out there and you letterbox, please go
ahead and steal my idea. I'd like to try and find your box
(snicker). If you're a dirty geocacher, I guess you can do with it
what you want... ugh.

weechat-android
August 25th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I just installed weechat-android on my phone and boy are my arms
tired. Wait, no... I mean, boy was that easy! 

I set up a relay:

/secure set relaypass yourmom
/set relay.network.password "${sec.data.yourmom}"
/relay add weechat 9001

Then I opened up port 9001:

sudo ufw allow 9001

Then I went into my router and port forwarded 9001 to gopher.black
(which runs my weechat).

I downloaded the app from the play store like a heathen (it's on
f-droid too, or direct from github). Opened up the configuration
settings, clicked connect, and nothing worked!!!

Then I closed the app, reopened it, and boom! Everything was fine.

The interface is great. Very intuitive for swiping around. If
you're an IRC junky and use weechat, check it out.
