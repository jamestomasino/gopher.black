Poison Sumac
April 27th, 2018
----------------------------------------

We had a storm here a few weeks back that did a bunch of damage to
the trees in my yard. One of these trees in the backyard split
into three pieces straight down the middle!

On Saturday I took my hatchet and a chain saw (literally saw-teeth
on a chain that you drag back and forth by hand) and I set to work
clearing things. In the process of chopping and sawing I failed to
notice that the sad tri-split tree was also surrounded by an
overgrown bush of poison sumac. (If you're not familiar with this
particular breed of awfulness, it's just like poison ivy or poison
oak, but harder to identify.)

I was mostly prepared for the work, wearing long pants and sturdy
gloves. I didn't have on a long sleeve shirt, though (it was
hot!). So, now I'm super itchy and covered in a blistery rash.
Calamine lotion helps a bit, but I'm ready for this ordeal to be
over.

I've gotten hit by sumac twice before, and thankfully this time is
much less severe. My first exposure was on a canoeing trip where
I failed to notice that the creek I was in was surrounded on both
sides by sumac. I was covered in a rash from the waist up after
that trip.

The second time was the worst. I was in Boy Scouts on a camping
trip and one of the new scouts tossed in a bunch of green branches
into the fire. It started smoking and flew into my face before
I noticed what was going on. I was just about to explain why we
don't burn green wood when I saw what it was. Too late. I was
hospitalized that time, as I got the sumac in my eyes and lungs.
No good at all.

I hope this clears up soon. I'm so damned itchy!

I'm not sure what went down over on grex [0] recently, but it
looks to have been sorted out. I'm glad to see everyone phlogging
again. Interestingly, it looks like the hiccup resulted in
moku-pona [1] kicking all the grex folk back up on top of the
lists.

Any of you grex'rs have more to the story?

The Hobbit
April 18th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I just hit one of the coolest dad milestones. I'm reading The
Hobbit to my son. He's five, nearly six, and I've been talking it
up for the last couple days to get him excited. Tonight, he agreed
to listen to one page.

"If you like it," I said, "I can read a little more. If not, we
can read this other book tonight and try again later."

He agreed. He lifted a stuffed dragon to his chest and nestled
into a spot at my hip against his pillow. I looked down and he
looked back up.

A deep breath.

"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."

He didn't want to stop at one.

ckeen writes [0] about ABC notation [1] on his phlog, a way to
write music in ascii that's convertable to other formats including
sheet music. I love the idea and have added a collection of
bookmarks to read. Maybe I'll get around to writing my own
converter to Shakuhachi utf-8 notation [2].

Arduinos
April 15th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Just wanted to say that I really appreciate the arduino and other
awesome, friendly microcontrollers. I'm getting a subscription box
from Creation Crate and it's stretching me to think of new ways to
use the device while also increasing my inventory. I just made
a memory game (like Simon). It was easy, but I never would have
thought to do it on my own. Next up is a distance detector which
I'm going to mod into a garage parking indicator.

Electronics was fun back in the day, but now it's also easy.
That's cool.

Backups are good
April 14th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Alex Schroeder wrote recently [0] about backup formats. It was an
important reminder that since I'd moved everything (web, gopher,
... is that everything?) to a raspberry pi and configured it all
to a working state, I hadn't backed up the system. Granted, all
the content I have is in git, but the system configuration itself
is worth quite a bit of work.

Evidence of this can be found easily. Tonight after I did a backup
(more on that in a second) I rebooted the machine and discovered
that bitlbee didn't start up correctly. I'm using kensanata's
fabulous bitlbee-mastodon plugin [1] to do all my social media
junk via IRC. It's awesome, but it was a headache to get working.
For some reason I couldn't get it to play nice with the apt
version of Bitlbee, so I had to compile everything from source.
Tonight when bitlbee stopped responding I ended up trying the
whole process over again, eventually giving up on apt again, and
reinstalling from source. (This time I properly set up systemd.)

Mastodon in Weechat is a minor thing, but it's evidence enough
that I don't want to have to rebuild the box. So, I unplugged the
pi for a few minutes, removed the SD card, plugged it into another
machine and 'dd' copied everything to an ISO. I don't think I need
to worry about doing that too often, thankfully, as it means
downtime for the box. If I ever needed to restore, I can flash
a new SD card, plug it in, then run update on all the git repos.
It will pick up pretty much everything that way, unless I do some
serious system additions.

I think I'll do the full SD backup semi-annually, maybe when
I change the batteries in my smoke detectors. It has a similar
sort of safety-maintenance feel.

Port 70 -or- 1436CON
April 12th, 2018

sysdharma posted [0], I replied [1], and sysdharma posted [2]
again about a real gopher convention. Go catch up if you haven't
read those yet. I'll wait...

[2] sysdharma - On a Gopher conference
    gopher://sdf.org/1/users/sysdharma/phlog/./2018.04.12

Here's the thing. I want to do it.

Obviously it's not going to be in-person, but a virtual conference
is totally doable. Here's what I'm thinking:

  - A 24 hour conference
  - Everyone can submit a proposal for a session they want to run
    with the following info:

    - Who you are (handle)
    - Title / Subject of talk
    - Duration
    - Preferred time-slot in UTC
    - Medium of talk (video stream, audio stream, etc)
    - Where will you be watching for feedback/discussion (IRC,
      Social Media, raw TCP packets?)

    We will need a place where these can be submitted and stored.
    It would be great if the submissions could be done in Gopher
    itself (anyone want to volunteer to write a cgi for
    submissions?).
  
  - After X number of days/weeks, we close submissions and print
    up a schedule for everyone to review
  - On the day of the event, it's up to the speakers to get
    themselves online in their medium. (Maybe we can get a 24hr
    anonradio takeover?)
  - Folks can tune in and join the relevant chats
  - Archive the shit out of all of it and host it EVERYWHERE

I also think we should do one or two "special" sessions and close
off the time blocks so they're not up against anyone else.
Round-table or panel discussions would be cool for this. I welcome
ideas.

Finally, I think a hackathon would be cool to toss in the mix. It
could be done the day of, or the day before and results shared out
on the day. I'm not sure what we could gather in prizes, but for
our retro-con I bet we could get a couple minor sponsors willing
to toss in some swag. I'd be amazed if smj didn't jump at the
opportunity to offload some old SDF stickers. ;)

Like the panel discussion, the focus of the hackathon would be
something great to debate. My first suggestion: "Gopher meets
Docker". What sorts of amazingly cool configurations could we bust
out for the community in easy-to-deploy ways? TLS? TOR? Whatever
you can dream up. We could vote on the winners on GopherPoll or
something.

Speaking of GopherPoll (thanks tfurrows for pointing it out),
I'd like to offer one up right away and get your feedback:

tfurrows recently wrote [0] about about the American need for more
space, more square footage, and generally bigger and better
things. You might harken it back to the "go West" mentality and an
assumption born from multi-generational standard-of-living growth,
but I have no real clue where it comes from. And tfurrows is
absolutely right when he says you get looked at funny for defying
that pattern.

[0] tfurrows - square feet
    gopher://circumlunar.space/0/~tfurrows/phlog/akr_squareFeet.txt

My dad certainly doesn't understand my desire to simplify,
downsize (right-size?), and work less. It's really frustrating
with him in particular because he worked so hard to achieve more
and earn more his whole life so that he could enjoy it later, but
he was diagnosed with a death sentence nearly the day after he
retired. How can that not wake you up to the here and now and say,
"use it while you've got it"?

I want a smaller house. Much smaller. This is my first home and
I got it for a ridiculous price because the housing market had
tanked two years before and the owner had been dropping his
selling price ever since. It's now worth double what I paid and
I can't wait to sell it. It's fantastic to have a bunch of space,
but we just fill it with things we don't have time to use. More BS
filling it up is no help to anyone. It's also a huge burden on us
maintaining it and paying utilities. I don't need to work harder
and longer to pay for things I'm not using.

Once we go to Iceland I plan on renting again (if their rental
situation gets cleared up, that is) and eventually working up to
a small home. I don't want any more space than I need. If that
means I have to go outside more, even better! Lowering my
cost-of-living means I can enjoy the same options or more and
still lower my workload. I'm not going to be able to match my
current salary in Iceland anyway, so it all aligns. Work less,
live smaller, enjoy things today instead of putting them off for
later.
