@sparcipx@mastodon.sdf.org found a really nice treasure trove of
gopher goodies on an ftp server [0]. I'm out of the house, so I'm
writing this to remind myself to do some archiving of the content
when I get home.

The Left
July 17th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I just received the following email on an account I have which
monitors conservative political action. I have similar feelers
into a few different areas so I can keep tabs on things. This one
stood out, especially in light of Trump's recent meeting with
Putin.


----------------------------------------
|   Authorized By Trump Headquarters   |
----------------------------------------

James,

Have you seen the Democrats lately?

They're completely unhinged.

They’re all over this country vowing to go further and further to
the Left. For weeks, they’ve been calling for harassment,
intimidation, even the abolishment of ICE! Now, they’re promising
to block President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee from ever
reaching the bench.

They want to ignore our laws, abuse our people, and obstruct our
agenda by subjecting Judge Kavanaugh to a long, drawn out
confirmation process.

They think their new tactics will chase all “deplorables” into
hiding… but the silent majority is not backing down. We’re getting
together and we’re standing up. We’re knocking on doors and
reaching voters for our National Week of Action to protect our
President and make sure we win big in November.

And we need YOU to join us by going door to door to spread our
message
 
REGISTER TO VOLUNTEER

James, the way I see it, if liberals want to come for our borders,
for our jobs, and OUR Supreme Court, and they’re willing to stop
at nothing to make that happen.

We CAN win for the Silent Majority -- not by stooping down to the
left’s level -- but by volunteering in your neighborhood to turn
out voters and spread our positive message of putting America
FIRST.

Please, join us for the National Week of Action.

Thank you,

Chris Carr
Donald J. Trump for President, Political Director

------------------------------------------------------------------

What struck me most was the blatant use of the Left as an entity
of otherness. Notice that it's the Left coming for OUR borders,
Supreme Court, laws, and jobs. The Left wants to abuse OUR people.
This is an interesting and dangerous shift in rhetoric. It is
essentially calling liberals anti-American and digging deeper the
divide.

In a similar email last month the language used was based on
fighting, shooting, and violence in general. "Strike back!" they
cheer.

This is the stuff that later generations will point to with
disgust and say, "how did they not see it coming?"

yargo writes [0] about a cool Morse/CW project he's working on.
A low-power, pocket-sized CW transceiver for the 430 Mhz band: for
Morse code. I love it! I don't have much interest in getting into
HAM stuff (mainly because I know it would end up being a huge time
sink for me) but I love Morse and I think I could dig something
little and portable like this. If you make it, I'll use one!

Flashcards
July 14th, 2018
----------------------------------------

User jakob phlogged recently [0] about getting back into flash
cards & spaced repetition. He found a fantastic solution using
emacs as he seems to be slowly adopting the "all things are emacs"
principle. I'm not quite to that extreme with vim, but I do love
me some command line solutions.

[0] jakob - replacing anki with org-drill
    gopher://jakob.space/0/phlog/replacing_anki_with_org_drill/text

Plain text is just simpler. I don't need fancy guis for 99% of my
stuff. Flash cards are definitely in that list. So, what's a man
to do? Obviously the only solution is to roll my own!

I started by searching a bit on the different styles of spaced
repetition (there are many) and quickly settled on the Leitner
System. It's usable by hand, so I should clearly be able to
replicate it with a program, right? It turns out that there's not
really any agreement on the specifics of the system. I watched
several videos on youtube who would almost get there and then say
something that didn't make any sense. The wikipedia page is such
a hot mess I'm not even going to link you there. If you want to
read some train wreck stuff, you'll need to go there on your own.

In the end I settled on the following as my interpretation of
Leitner:

- Flash cards get a front and a back
- Flash cards are sorted into levels based on your proficiency
  with the card
- All cards start at level 1
- Cards move up one level when you successfully identify the back
- Cards return all the way to level 1 if you fail to successfully
  identify the back in time
- Time is important. Sitting there staring at a card and working
  it out is not the same as "getting it right". That is a failure.
- The number of proficiency levels you use isn't important
- The frequency of cards being shown is determined by the level:
  - Cards at level 1 are shown every day
  - Cards at level 2 are shown every other day
  - Cards at level 3 are shown every 3rd day
  - Cards at level 4 are shown every 4th day
  - and so on
- Cards are reviewed only once per session with the exception of
  cards at level 1. They can be reviewed multiple times until they
  move to level 2.

I started putting together these notes yesterday into a README
file intending to build a bourne shell app like I did with burrow.
I was reminded by a coworker that I said I'd build something in
node soon, so I caved and used javascript instead. Yes, I felt
incredibly dirty the whole time. Even worse, it was really, really
fun and easy. Puke.

If you have node installed you can try out my app by running:

  yarn global add flashleit
  or
  npm i -g flashleit

That's right.... Flashleit! Get it? Leitner... Flash Cards...
Huzzah!

When you run the app you can start by adding cards. There's a menu
option for it. Cards creation will launch your $EDITOR. Card
fronts & backs can be multi-line. Ascii art welcome!

You can also mess with some of the settings in the app. Change
some colors, change the maximum proficiency level, or the delay
before the card flip happens. There's more color settings in the
configuration file if you want to go digging. It's usually at:

  ~/.config/config/configstore/flashleit.json

but it may vary on your system. All the data is stored in that one
file, including your cards. If you want to import a list or
generate one, just look at the pattern in there and mess with the
JSON itself. You're big kids.

Source is over on github [1]. If you try it out and have any
recommendations or spot any bugs, leave me an issue there.

shut it down
July 08th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Sometimes the little frustrations add up and spill over. I tend to
get very quiet when I'm at my breaking point. I shut down. I walk
away. When I was young I'd walk away in grandiose ways: from
relationships, jobs, responsibility. I've learned how to siphon
off the steam before reaching that point. I meditate, I walk,
I pray. I can roll with it a lot more than when I was a kid.
Still, sometimes it feels like it would be easier to shut it all
down and walk away from my life. It's not a rational thought. My
life is pretty damn good. The frustrations are minor things,
meaningless really. You can't compare lives that way, though. It's
not rational, as I said, and it's not logical.

I'm going to drink a nice glass of gin, read a bit, and go for an
evening walk. Tomorrow will start a busy work-week and I'll be
walking into it already stressed. It's not a good recipe.

  <title>New Keyboard/</title>

New keyboard
July 06th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Today marked the arrival of my newest mechanical keyboard,
a Planck from Massdrop. Planck is an ortholinear, minimalist,
mechanical keyboard. It's just 4 rows tall (no number row or
Fkeys). It supports multiple layers, though, so you can switch
between keymaps, or meta-layers, or whatever else floats your
boat. Right now I'm running with two layers [0]:

 - Dvorak
 - Num-pad & arrows

The Planck comes as a kit that you need to assemble. That means
laying out the PCB and base plate and popping all the key switches
in to place (careful to align the pins just right). Then there was
a great deal of soldering. I'm happy to say it went smoothly and
I had no issues with my joints whatsoever. The board is then
screwed into the milled bottom, some rubber feet are attached, and
you're good to go.

In my case I also had to flash the firmware to get my sexy layout
installed. There was a hiccup there as the software I was using to
create the layout had placed the spacebar in the wrong location.
Everything worked but the space! I actually took it all apart,
remove the switch, resoldered in a replacement, only to find out
that it wasn't a hardware issue at all. I changed one setting in
my firmware and we're all good again.

I'll need to practice using it, especially the layer changes.
Here's hoping I pick it up quickly. I suspect this will become my
favorite little keyboard buddy.

Space Gopher 2000
July 05th, 2018
----------------------------------------

What if quantum entaglement and spooky action at a distance allow
for us to create extremely long range connections, but with very
low bandwidth. "Why would that be the case?" you might ask.
Frankly, I have no idea. If you don't think about the details too
much it seems like something you could gloss over in a story,
though.

I want to explore that idea in a short story as a vehicle to
reintroduce gopher as the web of the space-future. No nonsense,
text driven communication across vast spaces would make for an
incredible aesthetic and a great reason to draw some attention
back to port 70.

I think of films like Alien and their use of text for
communication and it makes sense to me. Local running AIs and
super-powerful UI crap is neat, but for anything at a distance we
fall back on the age-old safety of text. If you imagine a universe
populated by ships launched and traveling at relativistic speeds,
we quickly encounter vast distances in relative time, not only
space. These time gaps are a bigger threat to communication than
distance. We cannot innovate because it leaves behind all those
that have gone out before. We cannot shift paradigms. We must
speak to a common level.

Isn't that a cool thought? I want to read stuff in that universe.
I want gopher featured prominantly. I guess I should start working
on it at some point.

Do any of you have any ideas to pile on top? I don't have a story
here at all, just setting, so I could use all the help I can get.
Or, I guess if one of you is feeling the creative juices flowing,
take it and run. I want to read it more than I want to write it.
