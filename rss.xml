robots.txt
May 24th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I've run a little disallow robots.txt file on this gopher hole for
a while. Now there's been more discussion about its inclusion on
gopher for gopher search engines. This leads me to a little
problem.

My robots.txt file is not meant for gopher crawlers. I created it
because I do not want my site crawled by web crawlers trawling
through proxies to gopher. There's some question as to whether
a robots.txt file is effective in that way (technically the proxy
should have one, not the site itself), but I thought it better
than nothing.

Now I have a dilemma. I would very much like my site to be crawled
by Veronica-2 and other gopher-centric search engines, but I don't
want Google plopping my burrowy-thoughts on the web. What's
a gopher to do?

Not going anywhere
May 24th, 2019
----------------------------------------

Remember like five minutes ago when I said gopher.black was going
offline for a bit? [0] Yeah, I'm full of crap. I spent a couple
hours tonight and migrated everything on that lovely little
raspberry pi that's been in my bedroom up to a sexy little VM on
vultr. Gopher.black is out among the clouds now, and it's not
going anywhere while I move. So, keep your dial tuned to that
gophery station if you dig what you see. More shenanigans are on
their way.

offline for a bit
May 23rd, 2019
----------------------------------------

gopher.black will be going offline for a couple months sometime in
early June. We're packing everything up to put on the container to
ship to Iceland. That includes my lovely little pi here. Once we
have a long-term place to live with internet access and a router
that I can set up port forwarding on we'll be back in business.
Until then, my lovely Moku Pona feed will disappear for a bit.

The good news is my high quality phlogging action can still be
found at the 3 mirroring locations I have:

sdf mirror
    gopher://sdf.org/1/user/tomasino
tilde.town mirror
    gopher://tilde.town/1/~tomasino
yourtilde.com mirror
    gopher://yourtilde.com/1/~tomasino

I'm not sure when this site will be back. I'm guessing sometime in
August. You can find me on IRC still during the break. 

þetta reddast!

Poppy
April 29th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I just learned about youtube personality and musician, Poppy.
Thanks, brendantcc! Her music isn't bad, and the humor she
obviously has with it makes it a pretty fun listen. The track "X"
is my favorite so far with it's genre defying silliness. The rest
of this (apparently 2nd) album seems a bit more like generic club
stuff, but still catchy.

Unfortunately for Poppy, I just grabbed the latest (and last)
Cranberries album "In The End". It fills that Cranberries shaped
hole in my heart perfectly. If you're a fan or still reeling from
the loss of Dolores O'Riordan then have no fear in picking it up.
Solid stuff. I'll be listening to this on repeat for a while.
Maybe Poppy will still be a thing when I dig back out.

  <title>Net News On Tilde Black</title>

net news on tilde.black
April 26th, 2019
----------------------------------------

What a great day for net news! Not only is cosmic.voyage,
tilde.team, and news.tildeverse.org (yourtilde.com) peering, but
now tilde.black has been added as well. Tilde Black is my tilde
dedicated to discussions, research and expirementation on the
topics of privacy, anonymity and and security. It's an openbsd
machine, which brought with it a new set of challenges. 

Here's a quick note on special sauce needed for openbsd:

- clone from source as there's no package
- make sure to install a bunch of perl dependencies listed in the
  INSTALL file. It makes heavy use of these during make
- use gmake not make if you can
- configure --without-openssl is a must. The specific requirements
  for TLS don't play nice with libssl
- once you make install the paths will not be /etc/news and
  /var/lib/news but rather /usr/local/news/etc and
  /usr/local/news/db respectively.
- innd won't start automatically. You'll need to change to the
  "news" user and run /usr/local/news/bin/rc.news start.
  I installed sudo to do it since my news user is non-login.
- /usr/local/news/bin is also the path to ctlinnd, which you need
  to install groups and restart the innd process.

Otherwise the setup was pretty much the same as in my previous
post. Very cool.

  <title>Net News On Cosmic Voyage</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190426-net-news-on-cosmic-voyage/</link>
  <pubdate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 00:00:00 -0400</pubdate>
  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
----------------------------------------
net news on cosmic.voyage
April 26th, 2019
----------------------------------------

Thanks to the hard work of pople like dbucklin, deepend and
vilmibm, we now have net news (read: USENET without the spam)
installed and working on cosmic.voyage AND it peers with
news.tildeverse.org and tilde.team! This is huge, folks.

To run it on cosmic, just type 'news'. I made a little wrapper
around slrn that handles creating a configuration file and
downloading group descriptions. You can also run it from 'menu'.
But that's not what I want to talk about on this phlog. Instead,
I'm going to _try_ to capture all the stuff I did to get it
working. INN2 is not exactly intuitive to set up.

First, the caveats:

- This install is on Ubuntu. Your milage may vary.
- Peering is working for NEW messages, but we don't have historics
  syncing across systems yet. It probably has something to do with
  control messages.
- Peering requires both parties to set this up. You can't just set
  up your system to watch another. Each host must explicitly send
  to another AND listen for incoming messages from other specific
  hosts.
- You must have created the local groups on your system that you
  want to receive messages. They're not created automatically.
  Again, this is probably a function of control messages that we
  haven't figured out yet.

Now, configuration:

- Install inn2. In Ubuntu it's just apt install inn2. On openbsd
  you will need to use the --without-openssl switch or it will die
  on make.

- Make sure that the 'news' user is created and all the folder
  paths listed in inn2's INSTALL file exist. If doing this via apt
  you should be good to go.

- Files for configuration are mostly in /etc/news/ with one
  exception in /var/lib/news which we'll deal with at the end. If
  you're not on Ubuntu/Debian, the paths may be different. See
  INSTALL for a mapping by system.

- /etc/news/inn.conf  # this is the main config

  Changes:

  organization: this is a site description in quotes
  pathhost, domain, server: all should be your fqdn

- /etc/news/incoming.conf  # where to listen for new incoming data

  At the bottom, follow this convention:

  peer ME {
    hostname:         "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1"
  }

  peer tildeverse {
    hostname:         "news.tildeverse.org"
  }

  peer team {
    hostname:         "tilde.team"
  }

- /etc/news/innfeed.conf  # where are we sending our data

  Define peers here. ip-name is the only required field:

  peer team {
      ip-name: tilde.team
      initial-connections: 2
      max-connections: 5
  }

  peer tildeverse
  {
      ip-name: news.tildeverse.org
      initial-connections: 2
      max-connections: 5
  }

- /etc/news/newsfeeds   # defines what we send to whom

  This is the most complex file and hardest to grok. Note the
  !cosmic.* lines in the peers. That keeps cosmic's local groups
  (which start with cosmic.) from sending to remotes. Change it up
  for your own system.

  innfeed!\
        :!*\
        :Tc,Wnm*\
        :/usr/lib/news/bin/innfeed

  tildeverse\
        :*,!local,!local.*,!cosmic.*,!control,!control.*,!junk/!local\
        :Af,Ap,C20,G12,U5,<32768,Tm\
        :innfeed!

  team\
        :*,!local,!local.*,!cosmic.*,!control,!control.*,!junk/!local\
        :Af,Ap,C20,G12,U5,<32768,Tm\
        :innfeed!

- /etc/news/server  # should be your fqdn

  cosmic.voyage

- /etc/news/nntpsend.ctl  # actually sends the data!

  # host : fqdn : size limit : flags
  tildeverse:news.tildeverse.org:2m:-t 180
  team:tilde.team:2m:-t 180

- /etc/news/readers.conf  # for local stuff

  newsgroups filters hide the junk and control folders from your
  local users. They don't need to see that junk.

  auth "localhost" {
      hosts: "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, stdin"
      default: "<localhost>"
  }

  access "localhost" {
    users: "<localhost>"
    newsgroups: "*,!junk,!control,!control.*"
    access: RPA
  }

- /var/lib/news/newsgroups  # all groups, local and remote

  tabs separate the group name and the description. The number of
  tabs needed changes based on the length of the group name. If
  you line things up nicely with tabs you probably counted right.
  These names appear in the newsreader clients.

  NOTE: before you add them to this file you need to actually create
  the groups using: sudo ctlinnd newgroup <groupname>

  control                 Various control messages (no posting)
  control.cancel          Cancel messages (no posting)
  control.checkgroups     Hierarchy check control messages (no posting)
  control.newgroup        Newsgroup creation control messages (no posting)
  control.rmgroup         Newsgroup removal control messages (no posting)
  junk                    Unfiled articles (no posting)
  local.general           Local general group
  local.test              Local test group
  cosmic.general          General Discussion
  cosmic.storyhelp        Help with storylines and characters
  cosmic.worldbuilding    Expanding the universe
  tilde.cosmic            Tildeverse chat about cosmic.voyage
  tilde.meta
  tilde.services.uucp
  tilde.ascii
  tilde.food+drink
  tilde.javascript
  tilde.meetups
  tilde.nsfw
  tilde.php
  tilde.python
  tilde.poetry
  tilde.projects
  tilde.services
  tilde.team


- OPEN PORT 119!!!!!

  sudo ufw allow 119


- Restart innd

  sudo ctlinnd xexec innd


I think that's it. Remember, your peer will need to set all this
up to point back at you or nothing will share.

If we figure out the control group stuff I'll make a follow-up
post.

  <title>Solarpunk Thoughts</title>

solarpunk thoughts
April 25th, 2019
----------------------------------------

cmccabe just posted [0] some thoughts on solarpunk as a cultural
phenomenon, as a set of aesthetics surrounding shared goals for
the future, and as a visual and literary style. It's worth the
quick read. Go check it out, I'll wait here.

[0] cmccabe - solarpunk optimism 
    gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~cmccabe/15-solarpunk-optimism.txt

As it so often happens on gopher, his phlog set off a chain of
thought in me that is tangential. It reminded me of a fantastic
book from last year's reading list [1]:

[1] Trekonomics: The Economics of Star Trek
    https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27040338-trekonomics

In this surprisingly-great book, author Manu Saadia makes a case
for the true vision of Star Trek future through the lens of the
morals, values, and hard economics that underpin the series’ ideal
society. It's a substantial work that deserves serious attention.

The utopian future of Star Trek is optimistic and it manages to
challenge us in many unique ways. It questions our need for
financial incentives, the mores of competition vs honor, even the
idea of humanity itself. It also reminds me of that endless
conviction of Doctor Who that underpins everything [2]:

[2] Intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism!
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sK5d3oshp8

Solarpunk is just this. Yes, there's an artistic aesthetic.
There's probably something to be claimed as original for
a literary style as well. Ultimately, though, it is a response to
the gritty, post-modern brutalism of cyberpunk. Instead of the
wastelands of Detroit overrun by cyber-drugs [3], we see green
pasture-lands infused with a shining beacon of optimism in the
form of solar arrays and wind turbines.

[3] NUKE
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hg-nM3YLnE

I can take or leave Earth Day. It's not a part of solarpunk as
much as a Delorian topped with a "Mr. Fusion", or as much as a guy
on gopher that powers his farm with a solar array and shares his
water conservation stories on his phlog [4].

[4] melton
    gopher://sdf.org/1/users/melton/

It all gives me hope. Star Trek, Doctor Who, gopher,
little-free-librarys [5], and all of you. Keep on being awesome.

  <title>Tilde Black Online</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190421-tilde-black-online/</link>

----------------------------------------
tilde.black online
April 21st, 2019
----------------------------------------

My new tilde community, tilde.black, is officially online:

Website
    https://tilde.black
Gopher
    gopher://tilde.black/1/
Website over tor
    http://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion
Gopher over tor
    gopher://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion/1/

It is an openbsd 6.4 system that will be focused on activities
around privacy, anonymity, and security. To be clear, this is not
a system for black-hat hacking (whether targeted at tilde.black or
outward), but rather for discussion and testing of ideas that
promote smart behaviors around privacy online. I hope we will
create some well-reviewed guides in the near future.

If you want to join tilde.black, send me an ssh pubkey and an
email address to receive your welcome email. If you want to remain
anonymous on the system, you can use a disposable email address,
and you can connect to the server via ssh over tor [0].

[0] ssh over tor
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190420-ssh-over-tor

Additionally, users on tilde.black don't get to choose a username.
Instead you are assigned 10 of the 10,000 usernames that have been
pregenerated from a wordlist on the system. You can log in to any
or all of them. They're all full users with all access rights. You
can swap between them in the forums (not live yet) or send email
amongst yourself. If you connect to the server over tor nobody
will know the difference!

In case you're curious, openbsd doesn't seem to have any noticable
slowdown with 10,000 user accounts. That's pretty cool!
