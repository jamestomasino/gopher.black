  <title>What A Year</title>

What a year
November 14th, 2023
----------------------------------------

What a year it's been. I've barely been on gopher or gemini at
all. So much going on!

What's eating up all my time? Well, at the start of the year it
was work, and then getting sick, and then more work as we took on
a whole extra client that we were pretty sure wasn't gonna stick
around. That turned out to be correct, and by not staffing up to
it we avoided having to fire a bunch of people, which I'm thankful
for. But then I was spent as well.

Summer happened, some travel, some not travel, things started
settling. Then I traveled for work to a different client thing and
got covid again. That sucked. My cough is mostly gone, finally.

Then I decided to take Icelandic seriously and enrolled in the
University of Iceland in a full-time college program. Now that's
dominating my mornings all week every week, followed by my job
dominating the afternoon and evenings. In the small gaps I get
that aren't filled with study, I've been playing in a few TTRPG
games. Well, running them, mostly, but that counts as play.

I'm in my last regular week of classes now, and final exams are
two & three weeks out. Then I have the holiday break before the
second semester. Thankfully this is only a two semester program,
so by June I'll be back to my own life again.

Oh! and Season 2 of Solarpunk Prompts has started up. I'm writing
and recording that somewhere in the middle of everything else.

I miss you, gopher! I'll be back, I promise. *sigh*

Riot Medicine
June 18th, 2023
----------------------------------------

I just added a page to my archives [0] area of this gopherhole for
Riot Medicine [1], an open source medical guide for street medics.

Riot Medicine is a full-length textbook that covers everything you
need to become a medic. The 466 pages include organizing, medcine,
equipment, and tactics. It is written for those with no medical
training and no experience at protests, but medical practitioners
and seasoned protesters will still find it useful.

There's also a field guide: symptoms and treatments without
theory, designed to be included in your field kit. Also available
in Spanish.

And there's a bridge guide for those already working in healthcare
designed to prep for the street environment.

And finally there is a printable Basic First Aid zine.

new years cleanup
January 04th, 2023
----------------------------------------

I went through moku-pona[0] to clean up some shenanigans today.
A lovely person reached out to me to be added to the list (hi
bandali! [1]) and while I was in there I noticed my perl stuff was
acting up. I guess the XML parsing was broken, so I did some CPAN
work and I think it's good again. I also noticed a handful of
phlogs whose servers seem to be down. I trimmed them for now. If
they return and want re-added I can do that later.

Grex.org in particular is a challenge. That server has long
periods of downtime, but usually comes back. I have a handful of
people there in the list and I've left them for now. We'll see if
it pops back online again at some point.

I've been really sick for the past few weeks. My son got the flu
about a week before school let out. He was in bad shape and we
nearly went to the hospital. Thankfully his fever broke, but by
then my wife caught it, and then it was my turn. My flu, as per
usual, developed into pneumonia and I'm still coming out of that
funk. I think this cough will be with me a while yet.

This weekend I'm going to try to record a new episode of Solarpunk
Prompts [2], my podcast series about the movement. If you haven't
checked it out before please do so. It's for writers, but many
non-writers enjoy it as well. The episodes are only about 10
minutes long. I recommend listening to the intro episode first as
it lays out what the podcast is about and its reason for being.
After that you can listen to the episodes in any order.

Oh! The podcast is not only followable in podcast apps and RSS
like normal, but you can also follow it on Fedi! Check out:
@SolarpunkPrompts@podcast.tomasino.org

I hope you all had a really great holiday and new year.

Another one bites the dust
August 09th, 2022
----------------------------------------

Lost another friend today. The number will start increasing soon,
I think, as we age more. It's hard to fathom, though. The number
has always been high. It's always too many.

I'll miss him. Less than some, more than many. He was a hell of
a human.

  <title>Small Internet Presentation At Mch2022</title>

Small Internet Presentation at MCH2022
July 29th, 2022
----------------------------------------

I'm back home from the Netherlands and MCH2022 (May Contain
Hackers). It was a whirlwind and quite awesome. I'm just floored
by how much stuff a bunch of volunteers can accomplish with
motivation and creative hacking.

The talks were amazing and most can now be found online on the CCC
site. There was also an epic CTF game going on the whole week (I
helped out in some lock picking challenges). The ad-hoc villages
created by visitors were endless fun too. What a wild ride. I hope
you all get the chance to attend one of these hacker camps in the
future.

I participated in one group panel discussion on social media,
disinformation, and fascism that was really interesting, but not
recorded. I also gave one of the curated stage presentations which
was recorded [0].

[0] Video of my Small Internet talk
    https://media.ccc.de/v/mch2022-83-rocking-the-web-bloat-modern-gopher-gemini-and-the-small-internet

My main talk was about the small internet, and specifically about
gopher and gemini. It covers some framing for what people mean by
the term small internet, what services and activities fall under
the umbrella, and a bit of sentiment and behavior information from
the survey I shared here earlier. Then I run through a quick
technical overview of gopher and gemini, and finish off with
a quick nod at pubnix and tildes. The questions from the audience
were wonderful and I hope it broadens awareness of our fun little
spaces. If you want to see the slides from the presentation,
they're a Nuxt app I tossed together for the purpose and can be
found here [1]:

I hope I get to go to another camp in the near future. Perhaps
next time I'll discuss contract based dependency management [2].

Small Internet Survey
June 26th, 2022
----------------------------------------

I've put together a survey about the Small Internet (gopher,
gemini, individual webpages, small community sites) and I would
love your input. Please spend a few minutes and fill in your
thoughts. I'm especially interested in the open response
questions. This will help inform an upcoming conference talk I'll
be giving at May Contain Hackers (MCH).
