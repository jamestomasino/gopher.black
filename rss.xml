net news on cosmic.voyage
April 26th, 2019
----------------------------------------

Thanks to the hard work of pople like dbucklin, deepend and
vilmibm, we now have net news (read: USENET without the spam)
installed and working on cosmic.voyage AND it peers with
news.tildeverse.org and tilde.team! This is huge, folks.

To run it on cosmic, just type 'news'. I made a little wrapper
around slrn that handles creating a configuration file and
downloading group descriptions. You can also run it from 'menu'.
But that's not what I want to talk about on this phlog. Instead,
I'm going to _try_ to capture all the stuff I did to get it
working. INN2 is not exactly intuitive to set up.

First, the caveats:

- This install is on Ubuntu. Your milage may vary.
- Peering is working for NEW messages, but we don't have historics
  syncing across systems yet. It probably has something to do with
  control messages.
- Peering requires both parties to set this up. You can't just set
  up your system to watch another. Each host must explicitly send
  to another AND listen for incoming messages from other specific
  hosts.
- You must have created the local groups on your system that you
  want to receive messages. They're not created automatically.
  Again, this is probably a function of control messages that we
  haven't figured out yet.

Now, configuration:

- Install inn2. In Ubuntu it's just apt install inn2. On openbsd
  you will need to use the --without-openssl switch or it will die
  on make.

- Make sure that the 'news' user is created and all the folder
  paths listed in inn2's INSTALL file exist. If doing this via apt
  you should be good to go.

- Files for configuration are mostly in /etc/news/ with one
  exception in /var/lib/news which we'll deal with at the end. If
  you're not on Ubuntu/Debian, the paths may be different. See
  INSTALL for a mapping by system.

- /etc/news/inn.conf  # this is the main config

  Changes:

  organization: this is a site description in quotes
  pathhost, domain, server: all should be your fqdn

- /etc/news/incoming.conf  # where to listen for new incoming data

  At the bottom, follow this convention:

  peer ME {
    hostname:         "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1"
  }

  peer tildeverse {
    hostname:         "news.tildeverse.org"
  }

  peer team {
    hostname:         "tilde.team"
  }

- /etc/news/innfeed.conf  # where are we sending our data

  Define peers here. ip-name is the only required field:

  peer team {
      ip-name: tilde.team
      initial-connections: 2
      max-connections: 5
  }

  peer tildeverse
  {
      ip-name: news.tildeverse.org
      initial-connections: 2
      max-connections: 5
  }

- /etc/news/newsfeeds   # defines what we send to whom

  This is the most complex file and hardest to grok. Note the
  !cosmic.* lines in the peers. That keeps cosmic's local groups
  (which start with cosmic.) from sending to remotes. Change it up
  for your own system.

  innfeed!\
        :!*\
        :Tc,Wnm*\
        :/usr/lib/news/bin/innfeed

  tildeverse\
        :*,!local,!local.*,!cosmic.*,!control,!control.*,!junk/!local\
        :Af,Ap,C20,G12,U5,<32768,Tm\
        :innfeed!

  team\
        :*,!local,!local.*,!cosmic.*,!control,!control.*,!junk/!local\
        :Af,Ap,C20,G12,U5,<32768,Tm\
        :innfeed!

- /etc/news/server  # should be your fqdn

  cosmic.voyage

- /etc/news/nntpsend.ctl  # actually sends the data!

  # host : fqdn : size limit : flags
  tildeverse:news.tildeverse.org:2m:-t 180
  team:tilde.team:2m:-t 180

- /etc/news/readers.conf  # for local stuff

  newsgroups filters hide the junk and control folders from your
  local users. They don't need to see that junk.

  auth "localhost" {
      hosts: "localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, stdin"
      default: "<localhost>"
  }

  access "localhost" {
    users: "<localhost>"
    newsgroups: "*,!junk,!control,!control.*"
    access: RPA
  }

- /var/lib/news/newsgroups  # all groups, local and remote

  tabs separate the group name and the description. The number of
  tabs needed changes based on the length of the group name. If
  you line things up nicely with tabs you probably counted right.
  These names appear in the newsreader clients.

  control                 Various control messages (no posting)
  control.cancel          Cancel messages (no posting)
  control.checkgroups     Hierarchy check control messages (no posting)
  control.newgroup        Newsgroup creation control messages (no posting)
  control.rmgroup         Newsgroup removal control messages (no posting)

  local.general           Local general group
  local.test              Local test group
  cosmic.general          General Discussion
  cosmic.storyhelp        Help with storylines and characters
  cosmic.worldbuilding    Expanding the universe
  tilde.cosmic            Tildeverse chat about cosmic.voyage
  tilde.meta
  tilde.services.uucp
  tilde.ascii

  tilde.javascript
  tilde.meetups
  tilde.nsfw
  tilde.php
  tilde.python
  tilde.poetry
  tilde.projects
  tilde.services
  tilde.team


- OPEN PORT 119!!!!!

  sudo ufw allow 119


I think that's it. Remember, your peer will need to set all this
up to point back at you or nothing will share.

If we figure out the control group stuff I'll make a follow-up
post.

  <title>Solarpunk Thoughts</title>

solarpunk thoughts
April 25th, 2019
----------------------------------------

cmccabe just posted [0] some thoughts on solarpunk as a cultural
phenomenon, as a set of aesthetics surrounding shared goals for
the future, and as a visual and literary style. It's worth the
quick read. Go check it out, I'll wait here.

[0] cmccabe - solarpunk optimism 
    gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~cmccabe/15-solarpunk-optimism.txt

As it so often happens on gopher, his phlog set off a chain of
thought in me that is tangential. It reminded me of a fantastic
book from last year's reading list [1]:

[1] Trekonomics: The Economics of Star Trek
    https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27040338-trekonomics

In this surprisingly-great book, author Manu Saadia makes a case
for the true vision of Star Trek future through the lens of the
morals, values, and hard economics that underpin the seriesâ€™ ideal
society. It's a substantial work that deserves serious attention.

The utopian future of Star Trek is optimistic and it manages to
challenge us in many unique ways. It questions our need for
financial incentives, the mores of competition vs honor, even the
idea of humanity itself. It also reminds me of that endless
conviction of Doctor Who that underpins everything [2]:

[2] Intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism!
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sK5d3oshp8

Solarpunk is just this. Yes, there's an artistic aesthetic.
There's probably something to be claimed as original for
a literary style as well. Ultimately, though, it is a response to
the gritty, post-modern brutalism of cyberpunk. Instead of the
wastelands of Detroit overrun by cyber-drugs [3], we see green
pasture-lands infused with a shining beacon of optimism in the
form of solar arrays and wind turbines.

[3] NUKE
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Hg-nM3YLnE

I can take or leave Earth Day. It's not a part of solarpunk as
much as a Delorian topped with a "Mr. Fusion", or as much as a guy
on gopher that powers his farm with a solar array and shares his
water conservation stories on his phlog [4].

[4] melton
    gopher://sdf.org/1/users/melton/

It all gives me hope. Star Trek, Doctor Who, gopher,
little-free-librarys [5], and all of you. Keep on being awesome.

  <title>Tilde Black Online</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190421-tilde-black-online/</link>

tilde.black online
April 21st, 2019
----------------------------------------

My new tilde community, tilde.black, is officially online:

Website
    https://tilde.black
Gopher
    gopher://tilde.black/1/
Website over tor
    http://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion
Gopher over tor
    gopher://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion/1/

It is an openbsd 6.4 system that will be focused on activities
around privacy, anonymity, and security. To be clear, this is not
a system for black-hat hacking (whether targeted at tilde.black or
outward), but rather for discussion and testing of ideas that
promote smart behaviors around privacy online. I hope we will
create some well-reviewed guides in the near future.

If you want to join tilde.black, send me an ssh pubkey and an
email address to receive your welcome email. If you want to remain
anonymous on the system, you can use a disposable email address,
and you can connect to the server via ssh over tor [0].

[0] ssh over tor
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190420-ssh-over-tor

Additionally, users on tilde.black don't get to choose a username.
Instead you are assigned 10 of the 10,000 usernames that have been
pregenerated from a wordlist on the system. You can log in to any
or all of them. They're all full users with all access rights. You
can swap between them in the forums (not live yet) or send email
amongst yourself. If you connect to the server over tor nobody
will know the difference!

In case you're curious, openbsd doesn't seem to have any noticable
slowdown with 10,000 user accounts. That's pretty cool!

  <title>Ssh Over Tor</title>

ssh over tor
April 20th, 2019
----------------------------------------

My upcoming tilde server, tilde.black, is going to be focused on
privacy, anonymity, and security. As part of that effort the tilde
itself is a playground for activites and code that supports those
efforts. One example of this is connecting to the server over tor.

As described in a LifeHacker article [0]:
[0] LifeHacker article
    https://lifehacker.com/what-is-tor-and-should-i-use-it-1527891029

    Tor is short for The Onion Router (thus the logo) and was
    initially a worldwide network of servers developed with the
    U.S. Navy that enabled people to browse the internet
    anonymously. Now, it's a non-profit organization whose main
    purpose is the research and development of online privacy
    tools.

    The Tor network disguises your identity by moving your traffic
    across different Tor servers, and encrypting that traffic so
    it isn't traced back to you. Anyone who tries would see
    traffic coming from random nodes on the Tor network, rather
    than your computer. 

We have tor running on tilde.black and some services are offered
there directly as "onion services". You can browse the website by
using a tor browser and going to http://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion. Or
you can view the gopher site at gopher://tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion.
Finally, you can ssh to the machine at tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion
instead of tilde.black.

    (Some people may note that the web link protocol above is
    HTTP, not HTTPS. Onion sites are already end-to-end encrypted
    and get no benefit from HTTPS beyond publishing their
    identity, which in many cases is contrary to the goals of
    having an onion site. Browsing non-onion sites on tor is still
    best done with HTTPS, though, because all traffic from an exit
    node to that server will need some method of encryption.)

So why might we want to use tor to ssh? Anonymity of course! When
you log into a shared system other users can see a lot of
information about you as a user. For instance, here's just the
first few lines of output from the 'w' command on cosmic.voyage:

USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
tomasino pts/0    98.22.17.30-     08:27    1.00s  0.09s  0.00s tmux -u2 attach

Well lookie there... my IP address. Depending on my threat model,
that may not be something I want to leave lying around everywhere
I go since it can be traced back to me so easily. So lets look at
one small way we can incrementally help stay anonymous.

PART ONE: tor on the server

I've covered this process in the past [1] to show how easy it is
to set up gopher over tor. Lets review the basics again anyway.
[1] gopher.black on tor
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180427-gopher-black-on-tor-part-1

You'll need to:
    - Install tor
    - Configure tor
    - Start tor
    - Find your hostname


Step 1: Install tor

Check out the install instructions on the tor website. In mos
cases it's as simple as:

    sudo apt install tor

Step 2: Configure tor

Everything you need to configure in tor is located at
/etc/tor/torrc. Edit that file and search for HiddenServiceDir.
Uncomment or add lines as follows

 HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
 HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22

The first line is where your hidden service will store all its
secrets, like the private key it's going to auto-generate for you.
We'll look there in a minute to find the hostname. NOTE: the
/hidden_service/ part of the directory path is changable. If you
want to run multiple different tor services by different names,
you can add more of these blocks and change that /hidden_service/
to something else, like /pants/ or /web/. A cooresponding folder
will be created automatically when you run tor.

The HiddenServicePort line maps tor's port to your system's port.
If you are running ssh on port 22, this is what you'll need. NOTE:
Running ssh on another port does not add any tangible security,
but can help avoid log spam from bots that hammer at port 22.

Step 3: Start tor

    sudo service tor start # linuxy style
    rcctl enable tor && rcctl start tor # openbsd style

Step 4: Find your hostname

As a super-user, browse to the directory listed in
HiddenServiceDir and you will see two files, a private key and
a hostname. View the hostname file and you'll see your public
onion address. Copy that for later. The private key is something
you may want to back up if you want to use this onion address
safely in the future. If you lose the private key you will not be
able to run tor at that onion address anymore. The generation of
onion addresses can be done more creatively using tools like
Eschalot to hash millions of possible onion addresses until you
find a pattern that matches what you like. For instance,
tilde.black has the onion address:

    tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion

PART TWO: tor on the client

In order to ssh over tor, we'll need some way to make our terminal
session or a terminal command run over the tor network. My
favorite way to do this is with a program called 'torsocks'. This
utility pushes a single command or an entire shell through a socks
proxy to your tor connection. Since torsocks is just a socks proxy
that means we'll need to do a couple things to get it to work.

You'll need to:
    - Install tor
    - Configure tor
    - Install torsocks
    - Configure torsocks
    - Start tor & torsocks
    - ssh

Step 1: Install tor

Just like on the server you'll need to install tor on your local
machine. Read up on the tor website to see which method works best
for your operating system. It's probably a one-liner.

Step 2: Configure tor

We need to configure our local tor differently than we did the
server. We don't need any hidden services this time, but we do
need to allow local connections to use it as a SOCKS proxy. Here's
the key lines you'll need to uncomment, change, or add:

    SOCKSPort 9050
    SOCKSPolicy accept 192.168.0.0/16
    SOCKSPolicy accept6 FC00::/7
    ControlPort 9051
    CookieAuthentication 1

Step 3: Install torsocks

    sudo apt install torsocks # linux
    pkg_add torsocks # openbsd
    brew install torsocks # probably works on osx?

Step 4: Configure torsocks

To be honest, I don't remember if this is required or if it comes
like this out of the box. Edit the file /etc/tor/torsocks.conf and
verify that the following lines are present and not commented out:

    TorAddress 127.0.0.1
    TorPort 9050

Step 5: Start tor & torsocks

Now that everything is all configured, whenever you want to run
torsocks you'll need to first start tor in another terminal or
tmux pane. Running tor is as easy as typing:

    $ tor

You'll get some interesting output before it eventually says 100%
bootstrapped. That means you're up and running. Now in your other
terminal window you can start the torsocks proxy connection like
so:

    $ . torsocks on

This will respond back with: "Tor mode activated. Every command
will be torified for this shell." And that's exactly it. You
should be fully running now and able to try your ssh connection.

Step 6: ssh

    $ ssh buffalo@tdblackjcbw5kc46.onion -p 1337

A connection like above will try to connect to ssh on port 1337
over tor using the user "buffalo". I'm using tilde.black's tor
address as an example.

So give it a try and let me know it worked for you!

Recently cat phlogged [0] a thing that made me sad. I like that
dude a lot and hearing about the tough stuff he's feeling made me
wish I could fix it.

[0] cat - anxiety, dispossession & cult leader live
    gopher://baud.baby/0/phlog/fs20190414.txt

I can't do much for your anxiety, cat, or fix the state of the
world's social spaces. I wish I could channel more of the fun
"small internet" vibe to keep you thriving. I guess the one thing
I can do is not focus on techy stuff on my gopher all the time.
I don't know what my ratio of tech to non-tech is, but I'll try to
keep it in mind. I have so many tech outlets and not many that
I can just write my thoughts as they come to me, post them, and
know that people are out there reading. That's pretty cool and
I don't want to abuse it.

You've got that too, cat. I guess if things feel like they're
boiling over, feel free to drop us a phlog and rant and rave, or
whatever it takes to get back to yourself. We all read it and hope
for better things. Even if that's all we can do, I hope it gives
you some solace.

And drugs.

Guys! hyperboreddoubt has a new gopherhole on tilde.pink (btw,
tilde.pink is a thing now) and his new place is focused on putting
together an invented language for the intersection of tildes and
gopher. Cool right? You bet your ass it is.

Conlang for Gopher and Tildes
    gopher://tilde.pink/1/~ff69b4

Now I know you're secretly into conlangs and have been working on
your own one that you'll use in your amazing novels whenever you
get around to writing them. You've got a whole folder of bookmarks
on this stuff and have the COOLEST. IDEA. EVER. that you can't
share cause it's special. So don't. Keep that to yourself!
Instead, join hyperboreddoubt and give him some of your B-level

April 14th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I'm listening to Go Go Penguin's tiny desk concert [0] right now
while I type this little phlog. You should join me if you can.
They're incredible. 

[0] Go Go Penguin Tiny Desk Concert
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47XlUL6sRow

Yesterday I got snookered into starting up a new tilde [1] server
called tilde.black. My reasoning was pretty simple: gopher.black
is literally the only .black TLD site I know. I can't have someone
else starting tilde.black! It must be me.

[1] The Tildeverse
    gopher://tildeverse.org/1/;tildeverse.org

So I was going to spin up a general purpose thing in Ubuntu 18.04
cause that's what I know best, but again I let myself get talked
into doing more. So, the machine is running OpenBSD 6.4. It's
going to be focused on privacy, anonymity, and security once
I open her up to new members. And I was close today! I had web
& gopher set up, lets encrypt all configured, tor worked on web,
gopher and even SSH. All was glorious. But then something wonky
happened with rcctl and a forum post I read recommended tossing
some config line in place and restarting the box. Big. Mistake.

So it didn't come back up and now I'm starting over. This time
around though I wanted to give some time and consideration to my
ssh keys and how I'm managing all that gibberish. One thing led to
another and Michael W. Lucas's SSH Mastery book kept slapping me
in the face. The way I had my keys set up was criminally simple
and insecure. I needed to do something before I launch a project
with security in the goals.

So, I bit the bullet and dove in to posts on ssh-agent and using
gpg-agent to interface with ssh and a host of other things. I can
now say with the confidence of a person who skimmed web pages for
an hour that all that shit needs some work. In fact, I hope it's
something the community on tilde.black will do eventually. There
should be simple guides for new people on these topics. There
should be examples, recommendations, watch-outs, and more. Instead
there's aging stack-exchange posts with scripts that throw errors
in modern ssh-agent, hordes of contradictory blog posts, and
worse. This is fundamental stuff for terminal work, guys! We can
do better. The knowledge is in our circle, lets share it, okay?

In the meantime I did what I always do. I said "eff it, I'll roll
my own solution with a shell script". And I did! You can see it
over here [2] if you want. Here's the gist:

  1) Every service gets its own ssh key. Period. 
  2) Every ssh key gets a password. 
  3) These passwords are not all the same thing. 
  4) Simple script to enable/disable the keys when I need them
     without having to memorize all the passwords.

[2] lssh
    https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/lssh

What I wrote is a wrapper around Lastpass, the password manager
I use. Lastpass has a cli tool called lpass which is great.
I added entries in Lastpass for each of my ssh keys' passwords,
placed them into a sync folder using Spideroak (my preferred
secure sync solution) and made an easy shell wrapper to activate
whichever one I need. The activated key goes into ssh-agent. I can
easily clear ssh-agent with ssh-add -D, so that didn't need any
special wrapping (though I may add a quick switch to my script
anyway for that purpose). It's all very basic stuff, again, but it
works well and brings me closer to "safe" for my threat level.

I'd like to clean the script up more and put some bells & whistles
on it, but that will come with time.

Next week it's back to the grindstone at work, but after Friday
I have a week off. My mother-in-law is in town and there's some
things I really need to focus on for the move, though, so this
break probably won't mean great investments of time into tildes or
even writing on Cosmic Voyage. There's a couple more months of
this ahead, and then craziness once we arrive in Iceland.
Hopefully I'll be slowing down a notch or two mid-August. :)

phlog listing updates
April 11th, 2019
----------------------------------------

It looks like tilde.town recently updated gophernicus, which is
awesome. Many of the servers out there running gophernicus leave
the bottom footer active for their users, which shows the current
gophernicus version that's running.

In my /etc/default/gophernicus I like to disable headers, footers
and the status page hidden at /server-status with the -nt -nh -nf
flags, like so:

OPTIONS="-o UTF-8 -nt -nh -nf -T 7070"

Part of my reasoning is aesthetic. I don't need to show extra crud
on gopher. Part of my reason is security. Not knowing which server
I'm running may make attacks on it more difficult. Not seeing IP
addresses of users engaged with my system helps them stay
anonymous (server-status related). And part of my reasoning is so
I don't accidentally trip up aggregators.

When you upgrade gophernicus and that version in the footer
changes, every aggregator out there suddenly thinks you made an
update to your phlog. This happens routinely on SDF and suddenly
every SDF member tracked on my moku-pona [0] sorts to the top of
the list. Today that happened for our tilde.town users.

Is it a big deal? Oh definitely not. Am I recommending others
running gophernicus use those switches? It's totally up to them
and I won't harp on the issue. I just want people to be aware that
it's a thing. I suspect many would choose to add the flags if they
knew about the situation, but I won't hold it against you if you
disagree, or simply don't care. Gopher is whatever the hell you
want to make it.

Speaking of gopher being whatever the hell you want to make it,
I was surprised to see Ze Libertine Gamer post recently that he
may be deleting his phlog [1]. That's a real shock, to be honest.
He's got some great content that goes back years. I wonder what
sort of things might lead someone to deleting a phlog but not the
entire gopher hole and I'm at a loss. I won't speculate here, but
I will say to ZLG, I really hope you keep it around, even if you
don't update very often. You've got some useful information you've
shared and have been a big part of the community. I'd certainly
miss your contributions.

To zcrayfish:

I agree. WebP does indeed suck. [2] Stop trying to make "fetch"
a thing, Google. Their sleasy method of inserting "switch to
modern image formats" into website performance checkers is dirty
and unwelcome. I don't like blackhat UI and I don't appreciate
their "disruptions".

Thanks to all of you who answered my silly three questions. I got
a lot of great movies to add to the playlist and I've been jamming
to your songs all week.

Keep gopherin' everyone!

  <title>Opening Gopher Links From Firefox In Lynx</title>

opening gopher links from firefox in lynx
April 11th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I was working on a goal of adding a new protocol handler to
Firefox that would open gopher:// links in lynx. I think it's
doable based on my research, but I'm not quite able to get it
working. First of all, you can expose a protocol to request a new
handler when invoked by adding a config item to Firefox via the
about:config screen.

network.protocol-handler.expose.gopher

Add that entry as a boolean, and set it to false. Now the next
time you click on a gopher link it will prompt you for the app to
use. If you have a standalone gopher app with gui support, point
at that and you're done! YAY!

If you're like me and want it to launch a terminal window, start
lynx, and browse to that gopher hole, well... I don't quite have
the solve just yet. I found three potential ways to do it so far,
but none is actually working.

1. Point to a shell script that launches a terminal window running
   lynx, and forward along the parameter. I created a bash script
   that launched gnome-terminal and passed along the startup
   script as lynx. Sounded good in theory, and if I invoke it from
   the terminal myself it does indeed launch a new term running
   lynx. That's cool, but Firefox seems to do nothing when it acts
   as a handler. Damn.

2. Define a new shell app like described in this webpage [0]
[0] Firefox enable starting of scripts
    https://www.bitkistl.com/2015/04/firefox-enable-starting-of-scripts-and.html

3. Try to make a lynx.desktop file that will launch the lynx
   browser. Here's mine:

   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=Lynx
   Comment=Terminal Browser
   Terminal=true
   Type=Application
   Exec=lynx %U
   Categories=Application;Network;

   That totally works once you trust it if you click on the app.
   But it does jack shit when you try to use it as a Firefox
   protocol handler. Ugh.

Guys, I feel like I'm so damn close. Who wants to be my hero and
swoop in and save the day. Gopher handlers will make my life 3%
better overnight. Don't you want to be a part of that?

Fun Questions
March 30th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I'm in a fun mood, so let's do something fun!

christyotwisty had a post on circumlunar not too long ago asking
users a bunch of reading questions. I'd link to it, but I can't
seem to find the phlog entry. Regardless, it was really fun and
got a lot of gopherspace engagement. I miss gopherspace
engagement! I want more. So, this is my blatant attempt to fish
interaction out of you all.

Who among you likes movies? How about music? Any readers? Good!
I was thinking of a nice, difficult challenge to throw your way.

1. Name one film that everyone should see at least once.
2. Name one book everyone should read at least TWICE.
3. Name one song everyone should listen to at least once a year.

Why those rules? Cause clickbait, baby!

Here's mine with no context:

1. Mary Poppins
2. Dune
3. Harry Chapin - Cat's in the Cradle
