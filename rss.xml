iUser jakob phlogged recently [0] about getting back into flash		gopher.black	70
icards & spaced repetition. He found a fantastic solution using		gopher.black	70
iemacs as he seems to be slowly adopting the "all things are emacs"		gopher.black	70
iprinciple. I'm not quite to that extreme with vim, but I do love		gopher.black	70
ime some command line solutions.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[0] jakob - replacing anki with org-drill	/phlog/replacing_anki_with_org_drill/text	jakob.space	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPlain text is just simpler. I don't need fancy guis for 99% of my		gopher.black	70
istuff. Flash cards are definitely in that list. So, what's a man		gopher.black	70
ito do? Obviously the only solution is to roll my own!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI started by searching a bit on the different styles of spaced		gopher.black	70
irepetition (there are many) and quickly settled on the Leitner		gopher.black	70
iSystem. It's usable by hand, so I should clearly be able to		gopher.black	70
ireplicate it with a program, right? It turns out that there's not		gopher.black	70
ireally any agreement on the specifics of the system. I watched		gopher.black	70
iseveral videos on youtube who would almost get there and then say		gopher.black	70
isomething that didn't make any sense. The wikipedia page is such		gopher.black	70
ia hot mess I'm not even going to link you there. If you want to		gopher.black	70
iread some train wreck stuff, you'll need to go there on your own.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the end I settled on the following as my interpretation of		gopher.black	70
iLeitner:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i- Flash cards get a front and a back		gopher.black	70
i- Flash cards are sorted into levels based on your proficiency		gopher.black	70
i  with the card		gopher.black	70
i- All cards start at level 1		gopher.black	70
i- Cards move up one level when you successfully identify the back		gopher.black	70
i- Cards return all the way to level 1 if you fail to successfully		gopher.black	70
i  identify the back in time		gopher.black	70
i- Time is important. Sitting there staring at a card and working		gopher.black	70
i  it out is not the same as "getting it right". That is a failure.		gopher.black	70
i- The number of proficiency levels you use isn't important		gopher.black	70
i- The frequency of cards being shown is determined by the level:		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 1 are shown every day		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 2 are shown every other day		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 3 are shown every 3rd day		gopher.black	70
i  - Cards at level 4 are shown every 4th day		gopher.black	70
i  - and so on		gopher.black	70
i- Cards are reviewed only once per session with the exception of		gopher.black	70
i  cards at level 1. They can be reviewed multiple times until they		gopher.black	70
i  move to level 2.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI started putting together these notes yesterday into a README		gopher.black	70
ifile intending to build a bourne shell app like I did with burrow.		gopher.black	70
iI was reminded by a coworker that I said I'd build something in		gopher.black	70
inode soon, so I caved and used javascript instead. Yes, I felt		gopher.black	70
iincredibly dirty the whole time. Even worse, it was really, really		gopher.black	70
ifun and easy. Puke.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you have node installed you can try out my app by running:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  yarn global add flashleit		gopher.black	70
i  or		gopher.black	70
i  npm i -g flashleit		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's right.... Flashleit! Get it? Leitner... Flash Cards...		gopher.black	70
iHuzzah!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen you run the app you can start by adding cards. There's a menu		gopher.black	70
ioption for it. Cards creation will launch your $EDITOR. Card		gopher.black	70
ifronts & backs can be multi-line. Ascii art welcome!		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iYou can also mess with some of the settings in the app. Change		gopher.black	70
isome colors, change the maximum proficiency level, or the delay		gopher.black	70
ibefore the card flip happens. There's more color settings in the		gopher.black	70
iconfiguration file if you want to go digging. It's usually at:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  ~/.config/config/configstore/flashleit.json		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
ibut it may vary on your system. All the data is stored in that one		gopher.black	70
ifile, including your cards. If you want to import a list or		gopher.black	70
igenerate one, just look at the pattern in there and mess with the		gopher.black	70
iJSON itself. You're big kids.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSource is over on github [1]. If you try it out and have any		gopher.black	70
irecommendations or spot any bugs, leave me an issue there. 		gopher.black	70

i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSometimes the little frustrations add up and spill over. I tend to		gopher.black	70
iget very quiet when I'm at my breaking point. I shut down. I walk		gopher.black	70
iaway. When I was young I'd walk away in grandiose ways: from		gopher.black	70
irelationships, jobs, responsibility. I've learned how to siphon		gopher.black	70
ioff the steam before reaching that point. I meditate, I walk,		gopher.black	70
iI pray. I can roll with it a lot more than when I was a kid.		gopher.black	70
iStill, sometimes it feels like it would be easier to shut it all		gopher.black	70
idown and walk away from my life. It's not a rational thought. My		gopher.black	70
ilife is pretty damn good. The frustrations are minor things,		gopher.black	70
imeaningless really. You can't compare lives that way, though. It's		gopher.black	70
inot rational, as I said, and it's not logical.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'm going to drink a nice glass of gin, read a bit, and go for an		gopher.black	70
ievening walk. Tomorrow will start a busy work-week and I'll be		gopher.black	70
iwalking into it already stressed. It's not a good recipe.		gopher.black	70

  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
iNew keyboard		gopher.black	70
iJuly 06th, 2018		gopher.black	70
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iToday marked the arrival of my newest mechanical keyboard,		gopher.black	70
ia Planck from Massdrop. Planck is an ortholinear, minimalist,		gopher.black	70
imechanical keyboard. It's just 4 rows tall (no number row or		gopher.black	70
iFkeys). It supports multiple layers, though, so you can switch		gopher.black	70
ibetween keymaps, or meta-layers, or whatever else floats your		gopher.black	70
iboat. Right now I'm running with two layers [0]:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i - Dvorak		gopher.black	70
i - Num-pad & arrows		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe Planck comes as a kit that you need to assemble. That means		gopher.black	70
ilaying out the PCB and base plate and popping all the key switches		gopher.black	70
iin to place (careful to align the pins just right). Then there was		gopher.black	70
ia great deal of soldering. I'm happy to say it went smoothly and		gopher.black	70
iI had no issues with my joints whatsoever. The board is then		gopher.black	70
iscrewed into the milled bottom, some rubber feet are attached, and		gopher.black	70
iyou're good to go.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn my case I also had to flash the firmware to get my sexy layout		gopher.black	70
iinstalled. There was a hiccup there as the software I was using to		gopher.black	70
icreate the layout had placed the spacebar in the wrong location.		gopher.black	70
iEverything worked but the space! I actually took it all apart,		gopher.black	70
iremove the switch, resoldered in a replacement, only to find out		gopher.black	70
ithat it wasn't a hardware issue at all. I changed one setting in		gopher.black	70
imy firmware and we're all good again.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI'll need to practice using it, especially the layer changes.		gopher.black	70
iHere's hoping I pick it up quickly. I suspect this will become my		gopher.black	70
ifavorite little keyboard buddy.		gopher.black	70

i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhat if quantum entaglement and spooky action at a distance allow		gopher.black	70
ifor us to create extremely long range connections, but with very		gopher.black	70
ilow bandwidth. "Why would that be the case?" you might ask.		gopher.black	70
iFrankly, I have no idea. If you don't think about the details too		gopher.black	70
imuch it seems like something you could gloss over in a story,		gopher.black	70
ithough.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to explore that idea in a short story as a vehicle to		gopher.black	70
ireintroduce gopher as the web of the space-future. No nonsense,		gopher.black	70
itext driven communication across vast spaces would make for an		gopher.black	70
iincredible aesthetic and a great reason to draw some attention		gopher.black	70
iback to port 70.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iI think of films like Alien and their use of text for		gopher.black	70
icommunication and it makes sense to me. Local running AIs and		gopher.black	70
isuper-powerful UI crap is neat, but for anything at a distance we		gopher.black	70
ifall back on the age-old safety of text. If you imagine a universe		gopher.black	70
ipopulated by ships launched and traveling at relativistic speeds,		gopher.black	70
iwe quickly encounter vast distances in relative time, not only		gopher.black	70
ispace. These time gaps are a bigger threat to communication than		gopher.black	70
idistance. We cannot innovate because it leaves behind all those		gopher.black	70
ithat have gone out before. We cannot shift paradigms. We must		gopher.black	70
ispeak to a common level.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIsn't that a cool thought? I want to read stuff in that universe.		gopher.black	70
iI want gopher featured prominantly. I guess I should start working		gopher.black	70
ion it at some point.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iDo any of you have any ideas to pile on top? I don't have a story		gopher.black	70
ihere at all, just setting, so I could use all the help I can get.		gopher.black	70
iOr, I guess if one of you is feeling the creative juices flowing,		gopher.black	70
itake it and run. I want to read it more than I want to write it.		gopher.black	70

  <title>Myths And Truth/</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180705-myths-and-truth/</link>
  <pubdate>Thu, 05 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubdate>
  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
iMyths and truth		gopher.black	70
iJuly 05th, 2018		gopher.black	70
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iJoseph Campbell was fond of saying that all myths are true. His		gopher.black	70
iline of thinking is that the myths we know and that our societies		gopher.black	70
ihave developed are culturally dependant expressions of a universal		gopher.black	70
istory. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn comparative mythology or comparative religion we see the same		gopher.black	70
iaspects echoed across time and space. In his mind there were two		gopher.black	70
ipossible reasons why:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  1. There are similarities in human psychology and physiology		gopher.black	70
i     that lead us to generate the same responses to our		gopher.black	70
i     experiences regardless of culture and climate.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  2. There is a shared truth which all of our myths and symbols		gopher.black	70
i     help us to express. That expression is unique to our culture		gopher.black	70
i     but it speaks to a universal truth which itself is ineffable.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat is a tragically simplified summary, but it should do for my		gopher.black	70
ipurposes as there's only a small point I'd like to make regarding		gopher.black	70
imyths. 		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  Myths are not true, they reveal truth.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iWhen Catholics look at the bible and read the story of creation,		gopher.black	70
ithat story is a myth [0]. It is not literal. It is there to teach		gopher.black	70
ius something about creation in language and stories that make		gopher.black	70
isense to the culture of the time. This reading with a cultural		gopher.black	70
ilens is vital to a Catholic reading of scripture, even the		gopher.black	70
iGospels.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[0] Genesis 1	/bible/Genesis/genesis-1.txt
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the book of Luke [1], there is a passage that should be		gopher.black	70
ifamiliar to even the most lapsed of Christians. It is the story of		gopher.black	70
iMary and Joseph arriving in Bethlehem for the birth of Jesus:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all		gopher.black	70
i  the world should be registered. This was the first registration		gopher.black	70
i  when Quirinius was governor of Syria. And all went to be		gopher.black	70
i  registered, each to his own town. And Joseph also went up from		gopher.black	70
i  Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of		gopher.black	70
i  David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house		gopher.black	70
i  and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed,		gopher.black	70
i  who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for		gopher.black	70
i  her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and		gopher.black	70
i  wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger,		gopher.black	70
i  because there was no place for them in the inn. [1]		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
0[1] Luke 2	/bible/Luke/luke-2.txt
i		gopher.black	70
iI want to focus on just two phrases in this paragraph:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  "he was of the house and lineage of David"		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  and		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  "laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in		gopher.black	70
i  the inn."		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStarting with the first phrase, this is an important note for		gopher.black	70
ia few reasons, biblically. It touches on prophecy fulfillment		gopher.black	70
ibecause it satisfies the messianic idea that the figure will come		gopher.black	70
ifrom the house of David. It is also important because of the		gopher.black	70
ipolitical implications of the house itself. The house of David was		gopher.black	70
ithe most prestigious of the Jewish people, after all. Heading to		gopher.black	70
ithe ancestral home of that people is a big deal in a culture		gopher.black	70
idominated by family value. This is a key point to remember in the		gopher.black	70
istory, too. Mary and Joseph aren't going to some small town in the		gopher.black	70
imiddle of nowhere. They're going to the home of the wealthiest,		gopher.black	70
imost prestigious family. The people of the house of David would be		gopher.black	70
imany. This is not a land of strangers for them.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIt's also important to remember that for these people at the time		gopher.black	70
ithere is a great emphasis put on the idea of hospitality. Elijah		gopher.black	70
iis going to return, and they must be ready. He may come in the		gopher.black	70
iguise of a beggar to your door. And so, welcoming in the traveler		gopher.black	70
ihas a major role in daily life. It has such a role, that it even		gopher.black	70
iaffected the architecture of first century Palestine.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe typical home at the time was made up of two main rooms. The		gopher.black	70
ifirst was the family's room. It would be raised up off the ground		gopher.black	70
ia few feet and be all open. On one side there would be a ledge		gopher.black	70
ithat drops down to ground level as the room extends into the		gopher.black	70
ianimal enclosure. The animals would stay inside in poor weather or		gopher.black	70
iseasons, and their heat would be shared by the family. On the		gopher.black	70
ifloor by this ledge were impressions in the ground where feed was		gopher.black	70
iplaced: the manger.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe second room was attached, often with a separate entrance. This		gopher.black	70
iwas the guest house or reception room, and it was intended for		gopher.black	70
ivisitors and extended family. We see such a room referenced twice		gopher.black	70
iin the bible by the Greek word kataluma. A kataluma is the room		gopher.black	70
iused by Jesus and his disciples during the last supper. It is also		gopher.black	70
ithe word used in this paragraph and translated as "inn".		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIn the ancient world there were no hotels. The closest you might		gopher.black	70
ifind was a tent filled with straw mats, called a caravansary. This		gopher.black	70
iword was translated to "inn" during the story of the good		gopher.black	70
iSamaritan. When the man is injured and placed in the inn for care,		gopher.black	70
ithat was a caravansary. In Luke we're talking about a very		gopher.black	70
idifferent thing.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iTaken together with our understanding of Jewish culture and the		gopher.black	70
iimportance of the family of David, it is inconceivable to imagine		gopher.black	70
ithe holy family alone in a barn on that first Christmas. The		gopher.black	70
ikataluma was full, so they were instead brought into the family		gopher.black	70
iroom in communion with many others. When the child was born he was		gopher.black	70
iplaced there in the manger where all could see him.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSo why do I bring this up? It isn't to criticize those poor		gopher.black	70
iChristmas pageants. It's to talk about the myths.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe story of Jesus birth is not vital to the story of his teaching		gopher.black	70
ior his role within the faith. If Jesus is born in the midst of the		gopher.black	70
imost powerful Jewish family instead of alone in a barn, there's no		gopher.black	70
ifundamental truth being assaulted. In fact, if you spent your		gopher.black	70
ientire life believing one idea vs the other idea, it would have		gopher.black	70
ialmost no bearing on your understanding of Jesus at all. Does that		gopher.black	70
imean it doesn't matter? Does that suggest that a bunch of these		gopher.black	70
istories are filler and don't have an impact on us? Well, no, not		gopher.black	70
iexactly.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThe stories, the myths, and our comprehension of them are trying		gopher.black	70
ito tell us something, but it's almost never the literal histories.		gopher.black	70
iHere in the story of Christ's birth we are being made to		gopher.black	70
iunderstand his place in the culture of the Jewish people, and his		gopher.black	70
irelationship to the prophets that came before him. In this way we		gopher.black	70
ican understand that he is legitimate. His role is appropriate.		gopher.black	70
iHe's not just some guy who found a bunch of metal plates in his		gopher.black	70
ibackyard [2].		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
h[2] Problems with the gold plates	URL:http://www.equip.org/article/problems-with-the-gold-plates-of-the-book-of-mormon-2/
i		gopher.black	70
iEach myth is meant to communicate something to us that words alone		gopher.black	70
ican't. They are intricately tied to the culture of their creation,		gopher.black	70
iand when that culture changes so must the myths. Without this		gopher.black	70
ichange they become distance, misaligned, and misconstrued. Before		gopher.black	70
iyou know it you are taking words from Leviticus and applying them		gopher.black	70
ito a whole different world.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
i  As for your male and female slaves whom you may have: you may		gopher.black	70
i  buy male and female slaves from among the nations that are		gopher.black	70

iOur dear friend cat is at it again. He recently flew the coop		gopher.black	70
ifrom SDF and has planted his seed in a new project called		gopher.black	70
ibaud.baby [0]. He's a resourceful guy and has quickly conquered		gopher.black	70
isome of the more tedious aspects of getting your own gopher hole		gopher.black	70

iHis most recent phlog touches on one of his passions, vintage		gopher.black	70
iphones [1]. In my humble opinion it is EVERYTHING that gopher		gopher.black	70
ishould be summed up into a microcosm of aussie geekdom. It has		gopher.black	70
ipassion for a vintage technology, collection, curation, more		gopher.black	70
itechnical details than you could have imagined, and a neverending		gopher.black	70
ithirst for more. It's also beautiful. His manual text layouts		gopher.black	70

  <title>Why I Use Gophermaps/</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180701-why-i-use-gophermaps/</link>
  <pubdate>Sun, 01 Jul 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubdate>
  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
iWhy I use Gophermaps		gopher.black	70
iJuly 01st, 2018		gopher.black	70
i----------------------------------------		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
imaiki just asked why I use gophermaps for my phlog instead of		gopher.black	70
iplain text. I know others at bitreich [0] have commented on the		gopher.black	70
ipractice with various opinions on why "misusing" gophermaps is		gopher.black	70
ibad. Plenty of people on gopher use plain text for their content		gopher.black	70
iand I am not going to complain. My choice is a product of style		gopher.black	70
iand philosophy.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iStyle:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iOne of the best things about hypertext is the ability to link		gopher.black	70
icontextually to relevant content. Gopher is missing this to		gopher.black	70
ia degree, but not entirely. We can't link a block of text inline		gopher.black	70
ilike in HTML but we can link a line. That functionality is		gopher.black	70
ientirely limited to gophermaps, though. Without the gophermap the		gopher.black	70
ibest we can do is include a text link and rely on the client to go		gopher.black	70
iabove and beyond the protocol to enable interaction (like VF-1 so		gopher.black	70
ivaliantly does).		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iMy choice, stylistically, was to take it upon myself to do		gopher.black	70
ia little extra work and build in the links directly into the		gopher.black	70
icontent by making my phlogs a gophermap. I first announced this		gopher.black	70
ichange [1] back in October of 2017 when I was still relatively new		gopher.black	70
iat this whole thing. In fact, I was piggybacking on the very		gopher.black	70
ibare-bones shell scripts that would later become burrow [2]. My		gopher.black	70
ifirst iteration was just a bunch of echo commands to a blank file		gopher.black	70
iand then launching vim [3]. These days I have the ability to edit		gopher.black	70
iexisting phlog entries, generate in plain text or gophermaps,		gopher.black	70
iauto-generate RSS, and a bunch of other crap.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iPhilosophy:		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFrom what I've seen over my time on gopher the biggest complaint		gopher.black	70
iabout gophermaps for content isn't about the effort involved in		gopher.black	70
icreating them. Instead it's an argument for purity in the		gopher.black	70
iprotocol. "Don't use the 'i' item type for this sort of thing,"		gopher.black	70
ithey say. "The 'i' type isn't even in RFC 1436!" And it's true.		gopher.black	70
iThe type isn't defined in 1436, and it definitely isn't pure		gopher.black	70
igopher as envisioned in the two-week sprint that a bunch of guys		gopher.black	70
iat the University of Minnesota did as much to stick it to the man		gopher.black	70
i(their school beauracracy) as they did to just get something out		gopher.black	70
ithere for the community to react to.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iSee, I don't see that as something to protect through purity. The		gopher.black	70
imindset of those guys was to iterate, to share, to build, and to		gopher.black	70
imake the internet better. They didn't sit for years in planning		gopher.black	70
ibefore deploying the end-all-be-all of protocols. They cobbled		gopher.black	70
itogether some crap on top of existing tools and made improvements.		gopher.black	70
iAnd that's what type "i" did later. It enabled us to write more		gopher.black	70
idescription than would fit on one line so there was context to		gopher.black	70
ia link.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iThat's what I see myself doing when I phlog. The links below (and		gopher.black	70
inow sometimes in-line) are given context by my post. If you're		gopher.black	70
ireading and say, "hey, I should check that out!" now you can. You		gopher.black	70
ijust follow the link and boom, there you are.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iFor those folks who don't bother with it and post in plain text,		gopher.black	70
iif I really want to chase down a link I can select it and manually		gopher.black	70
ienter it. It's more difficult, but it's doable. I hold no grudge		gopher.black	70
iagainst them for their choice.		gopher.black	70
i		gopher.black	70
iIf you are new to gopher and just want to toss up markdown files		gopher.black	70
ithat you're also using to generate a web version, go for it. I'll		gopher.black	70
ibe more happy that you've decided to add content here than		gopher.black	70
ianything else. I'm certainly not going to berate your efforts by		gopher.black	70
init-picking on whether you use type 1 or type 0. 		gopher.black	70
