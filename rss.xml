BBS
December 30th, 2021
----------------------------------------

I installed WWIV on one of my VMs. I walked through all the set up
and got it all configured out of some spark of nostalgia. Then
when it was done and ready to start adding content I decided I had
no content I wanted to share in a BBS. I have enough channels for
my creative outputs already. Too many, really.

So I deleted it.

It was too easy to conflate the installation and configuration of
a BBS as "having a BBS" in my head. I wanted to recapture the
feeling of the BBS days and the setup process faked its way into
my day masquarading as a solution. The BBS experience was one of
community, though, and of reaching out for a bit of nerdy contact
that pierced a veil of separatation. 

That veil doesn't exist anymore. The internet killed it. And so
what is left to penetrate? I already have contact with you here.

Do I add door games to this little corner of the internet and
entice you with FIDONet access? Maybe I dust off Phrack archives
or ANSi art galleries? With a lot of work I could decorate my
space like the ones of my youth and possibly entice visitors for
a drive-by of the museum I'd created, but that's still a pale
approximation.

Merry Christmas
December 24th, 2021
----------------------------------------

It's just about bed time here on Christmas Eve. The tree is
decked, the presents stuffed gloriously below. We have cookies and
milk for Santa on the table (and a few red pepper slices for the
reindeer). Soon this little boy will lie down and rest and we can
all wake up bright and early.

It's a peaceful moment. Merry Christmas from our peace to yours.

  <title>A Purpose In Life</title>

A Purpose in Life
December 18th, 2021
----------------------------------------

How do you find your purpose in life? That's a question that just
popped up on the Fediverse. I wanted to respond right away, but
I suspect my thoughts on the subject are going to expand beyond
a reasonable reply-toot. Let's explore the question together here!

First of all, the question was immediately followed by a sentiment
about searching for happiness, suggesting that a purpose in life
and being happy are related ideas, maybe even the same thing. It
may be the case that finding purpose leads to happiness, but
I would caution against drawing those parallels too soon, for as
you'll see, there's a possibility doing so may blind you to your
own possibilities.

In religious life we talk about finding ones purpose by using the
term "vocation." That word harkens back to Latin roots from the
idea of a "calling". Whether you are religious or not, I think the
term does a good job representing the idea that an individual may
be aligned well, or be well-suited to succeed at a certain
occupation or activity. If you believe in a higher power, you may
understand it as being meant to follow a path, or that you're led
to it. If not, it may just be something that naturally aligns with
your skills, morals, and sense of being. A vocation is a powerful
idea.

Which is cool and all, but how do you determine what YOU are meant
to do? Should you expect a big clear sign that says, "Dear
jackass, you should be a fire fighter. k thnx bye!" Even in
religious literature that sort of calling is super-rare. Instead
you should expect to have to go about it the hard way. That means
figuring things out on your own through exploration, testing, and
some deep introspection (and prayer if you're into that sort of
thing).

Where do you start? I'd recommend a simple list to get started:

  - Needs of the world
  - Your skills & gifts
  - Your true desires

The needs of the world are wide and varied. Some are enormous
tasks, like fighting climate change. Others are smaller and more
local, like volunteering at a food pantry. Everywhere you look
there are people in need, animals in need, nature in need,
probably even charismatic rocks in need. Maybe you feel
a particular affinity toward one of these needs. Maybe you feel
like your abilities are well suited to address one of them.

Thinking about what you're good at or uniquely qualified to offer
is another angle for approaching your path. Do you like to work
with your hands? Are you personable? Do you love spreadsheets? Can
you juggle? It really doesn't matter what the skills are, there's
probably a place they can be applied.

And maybe it's neither of the above. Maybe there's something
stirring deep in your heart that sounds damned interesting. Is
there an idea that persists inside you, itching away in a little
voice? Is there a subtle yearning to try it, to do something new?
That may be a deep or true desire of your heart, or it may be
something else entirely. You'll need to learn how to test it.

All of these ideas above are a starting point, not an actual
answer. Once you have something that has sunk its hooks into you,
however tentatively, it's time to test that voice to make sure
it's coming from the right place. Once again in religious terms we
call this testing the spirits, and once again the principles apply
even if you are non-religious.

There are several techniques for testing a decision. Here's
a couple:

1. Imagine you are very old. You've reached the end of your days
   on Earth. It's time to wrap it up any moment now. Here at the
   end you've taken a moment to think back on your life that
   you've lived. Think about that decision you made and imagine
   how it played out. Do you feel proud of that? Does it give you
   a sense of consolation to have done it or does it leave you
   cold?

   Now flip the script. Take some time to clear your head, then
   imagine the exact same scenario, but imagine you chose
   differently. How does that make you feel, looking back?

2. Test the spirit for its communion. Does this decision bring you
   closer to the people you love? Does it bring you closer to the
   community? Does it bring you closer to your faith? Does your
   choice build up those around you or does it build up you
   yourself? Think about those relationships that are important to
   you and think about how the decision feels next to those
   relationships.

One thing you'll notice here that we're not looking at is
happiness. Focusing on a decision that brings you joy can easily
mask the harm it's doing to those around you, to your
relationships with those you care about or your own spirituality.
Finding your path will hopefully bring you a sense of peace, which
then should bring happiness with it, but don't use it as a way to
test the spirits. It's too easy to be misled.

One other thing I want to mention is the freedom to give up your
own control. In most of the ideas above there's a sense that you
are choosing something for yourself based on some logical
criteria. If that's not resonating with you, or if it's not
drawing you to something strongly, you may want to try
surrendering yourself to a different sort of freedom. 

Sometimes our own sense of control is blocking us from the
possibilities of what we can really accomplish. We think we are
good at X, so we do X. We can't imagine we'd be good at Y, so we
never try Y. Perhaps Y even scares us. We're not well equipped for
it. We don't have those skills.

By actively choosing something new that scares us, that we feel
unequipped to handle on our own, we have no choice but to
surrender to the task and hand over that control. We might say
that we put it in God's hands. We might say that we're leaving our
comfort zone.

Try this: When you're thinking about the needs of the world or
listening to those sneaky desires deep in your heart pay close
attention to anything that bubbles up that scares you. Working
with kids? Working in hospice care? Visiting the incarcerated?
Whatever it might be, if it seems impossible and frightening don't
dismiss it. Give some consideration to testing it out. Imagine
yourself on your death bed looking back on it. Give it some
freedom to be possible for a moment.

Finally I'd like to reassure you that there's not just one answer.
You're not called to do one and only one thing. You will be called
again and again. You can reinvent yourself. You can expand to be
more and do more. You can change, and you WILL change. Even right
now at this very moment.

  <title>Scrobbles</title>

scrobbles
December 10th, 2021
----------------------------------------

When Tidal first came out I jumped on it right away. I hadn't ever
used a music subscription service before and I liked the hifi idea
and also the higher artist payout rate than the competition.
I stuck with it for a few months but ultimately felt it was too
buggy and dropped it.

Fast forward to this week. I decided I've been using Plex for free
enough for several years that I should contribute financially.
I have no real reason to get Plex Pass since it doesn't actually
offer any features I felt I was missing, but what the heck. So
I picked up the life-time Plex Pass and while I'm doing it
I notice they're promoting Tidal.

It's not part of Plex Pass itself, but the Tidal subscription has
a discount and integrates with Plex. That sounded pretty solid,
and they had a 30 day trial. I figure, lets pick it up and try out
the holiday music. Maybe I'll discover new albums to join my
collection!

It was an easy setup and it's running well. I remembered that
I saw Robert Plant and Allison Krauss have another team-up album
that just came out (spotted the vinyl at the record shop on
Saturday) so I checked it out (very good, like Raising Sand before
it). I also tried out the new Tangerine Dream album (good for
background, but boring for a focused listen). Overall I've been
poking around more in an exploratory nature. 

A quick aside…

I prefer to listen to music by album rather track. It's one of
a number of reasons I've never had much interest in Spotify.
I really like the arrangement of an album. How did the artists and
producers compile it together? Does it sweep through emotions or
jostle them? How did it kick off and what track is batting
clean-up? Is there a theme? There's just so much to it! I don't
buy songs; I buy albums.

But back to Tidal/Plex…

I'm clicking around trying out all this new stuff and I have
a moment of worry. You see, I don't really like subscription
services. If I can pay a one-time-fee I'm much more likely to
purchase, even if the cost seems cheaper to "rent" with a monthly
charge. Tidal's monthly fee is going to annoy me sooner or later
and I'm going to cancel it. When that happens there goes my
history of my explorations. Boo.

But wait! Scrobbles!

That's right, there's things like LastFM that let you scrobble
your plays to them so you can track them between services and
devices and get insights into your listening habits. I love that!
I have it configured for all my music players that support it on
this laptop, but I never thought about it in Plex, let alone Tidal
via Plex.

A bit of searching revealed that both Plex and Tidal have options
to link to LastFM (yes, I know there are open source alternatives
like OpenFM and I have accounts there too, but most apps are
hard-coded to support just LastFM, so I use it still). I added my
links and now my glorious Christmas binge is scrobbling. But wait,
there's a problem! I configured scrobbling for Tidal via their web
music player. Plus I can play it through Plex as a player, so one
of those two things should work, but they don't. I think it's
broken. *sniffle*

So that's sad and I feel robbed of my scrobbles. It's funny, but
it actually makes me want to use Tidal less! If it doesn't
scrobble does it even count? Haha. No, not that. It's not that
I need credit for listening. I want that data so I can reference
it later or get recommendations based on it. That's valuable to
me! Boo.

Maybe it'll get fixed soon. For now, back to Christmas.

distance
December 09th, 2021
----------------------------------------

Wife: I don't know what we're going to do if we ever have to leave
Iceland. I was just sitting at the mall in Reykjavik and I got
overwhelmed by all the people.

Me: I guess we just never leave?

Wife: But we're going to have to visit places!

Me: Oh, right. When I came back from my trip to New Jersey last
time it was a huge relief. Everything was just so much. Same with
Copenhagen, and that was with all the COVID distancing.

Wife: When I'm driving home to Mosfellsbær and I see Esja (a
mountain by us) I feel this huge weight lift off my chest.

Me: Same.

  <title>Five Questions Dec 2021</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20211206-five-questions-dec-2021/</link>
  <pubdate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubdate>
  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
----------------------------------------
five questions (dec 2021)
December 06th, 2021
----------------------------------------

1. How far in advance do you like to start planning things?

This is quite variable. Speeches and presentations that don't
require slides? Those I prefer to work on very briefly before
I have to perform. The over-prep and dwelling on it increases my
stress and doesn't make the delivery any better. But if I'm
prepping a larger project or something that requires lots of
pre-work, steps, 3rd parties, etc, then I try to get that done and
out of the way as early as possible. For instance, my trip to
visit family in the states next year is already arranged and
everything booked except the plane tickets (since prices are time
dependent).

2. What do you hope happens in 2022?

I would really love it if the vaccination levels across the globe
help us bring COVID to a long-term managable level that doesn't
result in waves of hospitalizations and deaths. The cascading
effects of that would be huge and wonderful. I also hope 2022
brings some nice moments with the family. The kid is at a great
age right now and I'm really enjoying all the time we get to spend
together.

3. What challenges have you recently overcome?

Hmm, I'm not sure. I've been fighting a sleep disorder recently
and while it's not quite overcome, it's very close. I hope that
wraps up soon.

4. Seasonal traditions you're most excited about

I'm a big christmas music fan and listen to it year round, but
especially on repeat during this season. It brings be happy
memories and sets a wonderful festive mood in the home. It reminds
me not to work too hard and to spend time with the family.

We've adopted several Icelandic traditions and added them to our
own family ones. We leave a shoe in the window for each of the
Yule Lads as they come to visit leading up to Christmas. They are
thirteen trolls that visit one-a-night on the days leading up to
Christmas Eve. Each has his own personality and will usually leave
a little treat in your shoe if you've been good. If not, you might
find a rotten potato in there instead. Wit has a bit of a beef
with Door-Slammer, but they're making up. Last year he left Wit
fake cat poop in his shoe.

What else? Hmm... We have our stockings and tree set up of course.
I put the tree up and Leah and Wit do the decorating. Then I put
the star on top and it's all set. Presents slowly appear day by
day leading up to the big day.

Santa is a big deal here still. Wit knows that the real Santa is
not the guy he sees at the malls. We've explained that he lives in
Finnish Lapland above the arctic circle, which is why people refer
to his home as the North Pole. We've seen the videos of him at
home with his reindeer pulling the sleigh. We've also discussed
how different cultures celebrate on Christmas Eve vs Christmas
day, meaning Santa has 2 full nights to travel the globe, plus
time zones to take advantage of. With proper planning it's
basically 3 days of activity to get it all done, and only in
predominantely Christian areas. Not such a big deal as the stories
make it seem. Wit also knows that Santa doesn't wrap his presents.
He leaves them loose by the tree.

Finally, we exchange books on christmas eve in the faux
jólabókaflöð tradition. The term actually refers to the publishing
industry going cray-cray and releasing everything at once here for
the holiday rush, but somehow it got memed into this make-believe
story about Icelandic Christmas Eve. In reality Icelanders open
their presents on Christmas Eve, not just books. Still, we liked
the idea of it and since we still open presents on Christmas day,
that lets us do the book & chocolate celebration the day before.

There's one other tradition here where people all go out for a big
Christmas feast. It's usually done via work, but there's family
groups and friends groups that go out as well. Restaurants have
a special menu for it and seats book up in August. Sadly we've not
been able to try this yet as it's been shut down the last two
years due to COVID.

5. Are you good at directions and maps?

Yeah, pretty good. I've got a great direction sense in the wild
too, but I get turned around in cities.

  <title>My Old Rss Blog</title>

My old RSS blog
November 10th, 2021
----------------------------------------

In the mid-aughts I moved to Alaska and took on a role which,
among other duties, had me overseeing the development of a massive
documentation project for the state's electronic grant program.
This documentation project needed to provide content in many
formats including PDFs and HTML. I was a big proponent of the web
standards movement at the time and saw an opportunity to build our
content with XML and XSLT.

That led me to getting intimately familiar with transformations
and how to style them for various formats. It was pretty darn cool
and pretty powerful. Of course writing documentation directly in
XML has challenges. So I also wrote schemas for the different
types of documents and set up Oxygen XML Editor with all those
goodies for our copywriters. It worked quite well!

At that same time I was also blogging a lot and thought to myself,
"Hey, RSS is an XML format. I bet I could just write that and
generate my whole blog from it."

So I did.

I manually authored one file, the RSS feed, in vim. I used Oxygen
here and there to validate things and build the XSLTs for the blog
pages, book reviews, and even a commenting system. Later I figured
out how to integrate 3rd party commenting into it and added a tiny
PHP handler to add pagination and links to specific entries. At
the heart, though, was just the RSS and XSLT.

Eventually I moved on from there to some other hot new thing, but
I have always been particularly proud of that. It worked natively
in Internet Explorer at the time and with a tiny helper script in
Opera.

The blog came up in conversation on Mastodon yesterday and on
a whim I looked at the Wayback Machine to see if it was still
around. Sadly the CSS file wasn't cached there, but the blog
itself and the XSLT were! I'll include a link below in case
you want to check out the magic sauce.

What sorts of crazy blogging platforms have you home-grown over
the years? Phlogs and gemlogs are of interest too. I use my
"burrow" utility for gopher. I bet some of you have some pretty
fancy stuff by this point.

apple nonsense
November 02nd, 2021
----------------------------------------

My son has in iPad. It's actually one that I nabbed from work when
we left the states. It's his only tech device. He uses it and
abuses it as only a kid can.

I recently picked up an iPad for work. I build sales aid things
that live on them and needed one for testing. That brought our
total apple devices in the house to two, so I figured it was time
to get us set up on the family stuff.

I was logged into both iPads with my apple ID because my kid is
a kid and didn't have his own. When I created the family thingy
I added him and now he's got his own apple identity. The only
problem is, the process didn't ask for a password creation. 

I realized yesterday that both iPads are still under my ID, so
I went to switch his to his ID and got stuck at the login screen.
I didn't have a password for him, so I followed the link to reset
it. After verifying the request via his email address and my phone
(text) Apple informed me that I'd get a note about the reset in
a few days.

In a few days?

Well I just got the email, a full day later, and I'm not
impressed. Apparently someone from Apple is going to call my phone
number on November 15th at a very specific time (quite late,
actually). That's my reset process? Seriously? Apple, the richest
company on Earth, and that's the plan?

I've never been a fan of Apple. I just don't understand the appeal
at all. Even the stuff they're supposed to be good at is utter
shit. I really wish I could go from 2 devices to 0.

I just heard that Onlyfans will be banning sexually-explicit
content on their network soon. Wow, just wow. The groups behind
the effort include Mastercard and by groups like Exodus Cry and
the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), which have
waged years-long campaigns against sex-work.

What's truly remarkable is that the site caved to this pressure
rather than seek out alternative payment options. This will
utterly destroy them, clearly, but they've gone ahead with the
decision anyway. I would love to have a bug in that board room.

Time will tell where the mass exodus of those artists will lead.
Much like the Tumblr diaspora there will likely be some time of
flux as different platforms are explored. An enterprising startup
could clearly step in here and inherit a wealth of business.

In the meantime, I'm going to do my part. Gopher Black isn't
a prude and isn't afraid of sex-work. See?
