Move your feet
May 22nd, 2018
----------------------------------------

It's been a while since my last phlog*. I've been wanting to get
back on gopher and do some serious plain text awesomeness, or at
least comment on the really cool happenings around the space. Cat,
love your diet, tell me more! How are you and your partner going
to handle it when you go back down under? Sparkipx, how's Felix
holding up now that you've been able to ride for a couple weeks?
Is it harder to do long distances on a folding bike than
a non-folding one? I've never tried one before. jynx, I'm totally
fascinated by single player RPGs and I need to go back through and
read up on your stuff. Tabletop role-playing is my #1 activity of
awesome, and that sounds stellar. horsemans has a cool gopher
wishlist that you guys should check out. I bet you can offer a lot
of responses there. [0]

[0] horesmans - gopher wishlist
    gopher://horsemans.online/0/2017-12-29-gopher-wishlist.md

Several of you are on vacation or soon returning. Welcome back and
all that. I hope you'll share insights and adventures. I love
travel stories so much. Hell, I love STORIES so much. tfurrows,
I'll be checking out Variations soon! Oh, and I have a Fiskers
push-mower and it's badass. I have to use it twice a week or the
grass grows too long for it to be effective. That part sucks. But
if you have a really small lawn, it's so nice to be able to handle
it quietly and "naturally".

Recently I've been absorbed in a string of poor projects at work
that have been eating up my mental energies. The work isn't hard,
but the clients have been difficult. I've been avoiding
unnecessary computer time as a way of disconnecting. Marry that up
with some unexpected (but welcome) consulting work, and my time
became even more short. Mostly, though, the thing that's kept me
away is a rededication to that principle I mentioned in recent
posts, deliberate practice.

I've been working on my shakuhachi quite a bit, and even met with
my kali instructor in the park at the side of a lake for
a fantastic jam in the rain. He built me a new shakuhachi, which
is just fantastic. It's a 1.9 (slightly deeper sound than the
standard 1.8) jin nashi flute and it's absolutely perfect. I'll be
sewing a new case for it soon, and an extra for him as well in
thanks.

I've also been walking a shit-ton. Every morning I wake at 6:35
and head outside to walk 2 to 2.5 miles on the canal towpath that
is the road I live on. Each evening, after putting my son to bed,
I head back outside and do another 2 miles. Sometimes I zip around
the neighborhood for a change of scenery. Sometimes I head into
town and walk the sidewalks. Most often I stay next to the canal
where I know the landscape features that mark my distance by
heart. I pop headphones in and binge audiobooks while I'm out
there. It's heaven.

Walking is a "keystone habit" for me, a term I learned from that
book on Habits with the yellow cover that I can't remember the
name of. When I walk, I do other good things as well. I eat well,
I sleep well, I think clearly. If I don't walk, holding on to the
other things is more difficult. So, walking rocks!

Hopefully I'll have more to share soon. In the meantime, I need to
go for a walk.

------

* I have a pet peeve about when people waste time in blogs and
phlogs talking about how they haven't posted in a long time.
That's the nature of the medium and the repetitive act of
explaining or apologizing for it serves no purpose except to make
you self-conscious. Now here I am doing it myself. Stupid.

More updates
May 22nd, 2018
----------------------------------------

That's a little depressing. After 11 days away I just wrote a long
update that is substantively the same thing I wrote 11 days ago.
I feel the need to amend this with some additional updates:

FBI File [0] - I received my FBI results. There are no records of
me in their files. I could follow up and request further research
looking for me in cross-references, but I think I'm good enough
with what I got. I'm still waiting for replies from the other
intel orgs.

[0] FBI Files
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180505-fbi-files

Poison Sumac [1] - It's finally gone. Holy shit that took a long
time.

[1] Poison Sumac
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180427-poison-sumac

The Hobbit [2] - The boy is loving it. We haven't gotten to read
it every night, but he's so excited about what's coming (I gave
hints). He talks about Smaug all the time despite having not met
him yet. He's excited for the giant spiders because I have
horrible arachnophobia and he thinks that's funny. We're just
leaving Rivendell and the Last Homely House. I can't wait for
Gollum!

[2] The Hobbit
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180418-the-hobbit

Finally, I've been brainstorming some ideas and getting some good
feedback from mastodon folks about a talk I want to present at
Barcamp Philly this year. I'll get it all ready to go and
hopefully it'll be something people want to attend. If not, I'll
record it and keep it ready for 1436CON/Port 70 [3].

Practice updates
May 11th, 2018
----------------------------------------

It's good to celebrate small victories. This week has been full of
them. I've kept up with my goal of deliberate practice regarding
writing, playing music, and even exercise. It feels great to be on
track. The next challenge will be to keep it going through the ups
and downs and boring times.

Regarding exercise, I'm well back into ketosis again (thank God)
and I've ramped up my walking. I'm walking two miles in the
morning and again in the evening. That's long been my foundation
or keystone habit to hold everything together and it seems to be
working again. I have been eating well and not snacking. The focus
has helped with my practice. All is well!

First let me offer my condolences to tfurrows for the loss of
a long phlog post. [0] Your loss is also ours.

Second, let me suggest a slight modification to your workflow:
- Generate a tmp-file for authoring
- Process tmp-file in a secondary stage for formatting

If the formatting fails, you still have your temp file.

Alternatively, vim will save everything you type to a swap-file as
you type it, and preserve undo states. Come to the dark side.

  <title>On The Default Of Democracy</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/0/phlog/./20180507-on-the-default-of-democracy/gophermap</link>
  <pubdate>Mon, 07 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubdate>

On the default of democracy
May 07th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Richard Stallman found himself in nerd-headlines today when an
article circulated on Hacker News and Lobste.rs titled "Who
Controls glibc?" [0]

[0] Who Controls glibc?
    http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/753646/a6ebb50040c5862c/

In short, some of the maintainers of glibc attempted to remove
a comment that Stallman had added to the source in the 90s. This
comment was a reference to censorship in the form of hyperbole
about the function being named "abort". Sensationalized headlines
refer to it as a bad abortion joke, but that is clearly
a mischaracterization. Regardless of the content of the comment
itself, it was Stallman's response that created a minor
controversy.

The maintainers claim they had consensus in the community that the
comment (they refer to it as a joke) was unnecessary in the code
and should be removed. Stallman stated firmly that it will not be
removed. This created an abrupt conflict in the eyes of the
maintainers who believed that the project is community controlled.
Stallman stated unequivocally that he is the de facto decision
maker of the GNU Project, which trumps community.

Now I've previously mentioned that I'm a monarchist [1], and not
in favor of democracy as a general rule. You will therefore
understand why I inherently support Stallman's position. But lets
dive a bit deeper anyway.

[1] Confessions of a Monarchist
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180315-confessions-of-a-monarchist

The glibc maintainers are upset that Stallman, who in their eyes
is not contributing code to the project, has authority over it.
They feel that a majority rule (or at the very minimum,
a consensus of the vocal maintainers) should decide how the
project proceeds. We see this in a lot of open source projects
these days, and it's promoted in the form of community guidelines
more and more often. The struggles that happen within communities
as a result of actions against the community guidelines is often
public and brutal. In most cases it involves the ostracising of
individuals and occasionally forks in code bases. In some more
extreme cases it involves doxxing and personal attacks.

In all these cases the problem is pointed at the individual who
broke outside the line of acceptable behavior according to the
group. This is bread-and-butter stuff for democracy, especially in
the age of maximized sensitivity. Let me give you a real example:

Just a few weeks ago there was honest conversation and debate, in
some places heated, about whether or not a variable name within
the Mastodon source code should refer to the "dark web" by that
name. Never mind that the dark web is not something named by
Mastodon, the community at large converged on the idea that it was
inherently racist because it suggested some sort of evil, and by
including the name "dark" it was somehow also inferring that black
people are bad. I'm not exaggerating here. This was the actual
conversation and the community as a whole moved in the direction
of "yes, that's racist and we should rename the variable name."

There's so many things wrong with the specific argument, but I'm
not going to address them at all. Instead I'm going to focus on
the structure of community projects themselves. They are almost
always created by someone. Not some group, some one. Even when
a group is involved, there is almost always a leader, whether
defined or naturally as a part of that group. If the leader is the
ultimate decision maker, then these conflicts have an authority
which can address issues that arise. If there is no authority, the
issue must be raised to everyone. In many cases, the very act of
raising an issue to everyone is going to escalate that issue, and
once it is escalated, there's no bringing it back to Earth.

In a group which has an authority, the whims of the masses are
normalized. The fad of the day is quietly passed by and the
project avoids moving with tides of opinion. If given over to the
mob, the loudest will prevail or destroy.

Democracy's lie is that everyone gets an equal voice. This isn't
true because not everyone is equally aware and equally
understands, and has the equal background to make their equal
decision. Instead, the group relies on those who stand tall and
shout to the masses. "Rally around me!" they cry. "I understand
what needs to change." And so the democratic individual is
presented with a choice. It is not a choice born of her natural
inclination and understanding of the world, but a response to
a loud individual. This spark invites other loud individuals to
chime in and steer the conversation. Their voices are not equal
still. The ability to speak may be equal, but that is all.

(Small aside: I live next to a canal with a lot of wildlife. A fox
just managed to sneak up on a goose and it is being loudly
murdered outside my window. It's rather distracting.)

Where was I? Oh right.

Stallman is in charge of GNU. This is good. Without someone in
charge, GNU would float on the eddies of popular opinion. Instead,
it is a bulwark standing for freedom. Freedom as in liberty.
Liberty, which I've previously discussed, is diametrically opposed
to equality. Of course that's how he runs things. Any other way
would be as ridiculous as the idea of censoring a joke about the
overreach of censorship in a project dedicated to fighting fucking
censorship.

  <title>Deliberate Practice</title>

Deliberate Practice
May 07th, 2018
----------------------------------------

There's a fantastic article circulating on the typical nerd
portals today regarding "deep work" and "deliberate practice" [0].
Give it a read if you haven't already.

[0] The Importance of Deep Work
    http://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/

One of the things I enjoyed most about the post was the summary of
methods of deep work taken from a great book on the subject [1].

[1] Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World
    http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work

  Monastic: 
  "This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by
  eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations."
  — isolate yourself for long periods of time without
  distractions; no shallow work allowed. 

  Bimodal: 
  "This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some
  clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest
  open to everything else." – dedicate a few consecutive days
  (like weekends, or a Sunday, for example) for deep work only, at
  least one day a week.

  Rhythmic: 
  "This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently
  start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple
  regular habit." – create a daily habit of three to four hours
  every day to perform deep work on your project.

  Journalistic: 
  "in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your
  schedule." — Not recommended to try out first, since you first
  need to accustom yourself to deep work.

This put into words a struggle I've had with my own strategies.
I've tried dedicating a set amount of time, sort of like "Rythmic"
but that time hasn't been long enough to establish a deep work
flow. I've set aside days of the week for it like Bimodal, but
rarely with the isolation necessary to really dig in. Occasionally
I'm successful, but I think it's more to do with luck, or
a motivation I happened to find that day, than any deliberatet
planning.

In the past I've spoken about freezing up when an opportunity for
exploration appears [2]. I'm combatting that with organization of
lists so I can refer back to these projects I have moving and
I don't waste time spinning my wheels. All of it is a part of the
effort to get back the time that should belong to me that I give
away out of a combination of laziness and poor planning [3].

[2] Stuck
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180501-stuck
[3] Resolution
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180101-resolution

Ultimately, there are skills I want to improve. The top of that
list are my writing craft and the Shakuhachi [4]. In reality the
list is quite a bit longer. Even so, I have the ability, I have
the time, and I have the necessary components to make a go of it.

[4] Shakuhachi (UTF-8)
    gopher://gopher.black/1/explorations/shakuhachi

Deliberate practice, not just sitting around fiddling with crap,
is the difference I'm missing. I've told it to my son a lot, and
I'll continue to do so in the future. You can't just go along with
things and expect to learn and grow. You need to do the hard
things [5]. When I practice with the Shakuhachi, I can't just go
sit on the porch and play improvisations for twenty minutes.
I have specific things I need to improve: timing, embouchure,
breathing dynamics. My writing is the same. I'm working on
a writing exercise and I've given myself a specific goal to focus
on brevity. This is good.

[5] Do the Hard Thing
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20171108-do-the-hard-thing

It's not just about doing things with my hobby time. It's work in
itself and I need to commit to it, at least a significant portion
of the time, if I want to improve.

FBI Files
May 05th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I was sorting through some of my bookmarks tonight and I ran
across something that I pinned for myself and completely forgot
about. It's a site called "Get My FBI File". [0]

[0] Get My FBI File
    http://getmyfbifile.com/

It's a simple form that generates you a bunch of letters that you
can print off and mail in under the Freedom of Information Act to
request government agency files on you. (The FAQ states you can
send the requests even if you aren't a US citizen, with a few
modifications).

I filled out all of them and will drop them in the mail Monday
morning. I doubt there's much in those files on me, if anything,
but I just don't know for sure. That's enough reason in itself to
send the requests.

Minor writing update
May 04th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I managed to add a bit more to my "storymatic" [0] writing
exercise. For those that missed that one, it's a thing where
I draw some cards out of a box that give me an idea for
a character and a story hook and I write a short story from there.
It's your typical writing prompt deal, but it's all fancy and
randomized. 

Swing over and check it out if you're in the mood. [1] I think
I like how this one is turning out. I need to decide how I want to
wrap it up.

I've also been re-reading where I left off with Emergence [2].
I may insert some other content before the current chapter three.
I think the revelations in that chapter came too soon and I have
more to add before it happens.

I'm glad to feel the writing itch come back.

The games we play
May 01st, 2018
----------------------------------------

There's been a lot of people talking recently about games they're
playing, whether on the computer, board game, or pencil-based
RPGs. It's been really inspiring.

I love RPGs so much, and I'm happy that I've got a monthly game
going with a local crew. We're playing online with Discord and
Roll20.net and it's... fair. I prefer no electronics involved in
my table-top, and everyone around the same table. Still, I'll take
what I can get.

At work I spent a little bit of my team-building budget to buy
a couple board games. Charterstone, a fancy new legacy game, and
a casual game called Lattice are the first purchases. I'll report
back on how they work soon.

I've also been thinking about other games I play or have played
with my friends over the years. Some are easily categorized, like
the D&D campaigns I've run or played in. Others are hard to pin
down, like the De Profundis writing-game I've got here on
gopher.black [0].

[0] De Profundis
    gopher://gopher.black/1/writing/deprofundis

This is a game of sorts, but it's also collaborative writing. It
started with the first letter when I wrote it in an email to my
friend Dan. I didn't give much explanation other than, "you get to
write from the other side and move the story along." We don't
communicate about our plans for each letter and we can introduce
characters as we see fit. We meticulously research historical
locations and events to prepare each one, and try to keep to the
style of the time as best as we're able. Dan's got the next letter
coming my way soon and I'm thrilled.

My game experience isn't all table-top or computer based, of
course. When I was a teen in Boy Scouts we did a lot of
night-gaming. Usually it was something akin to capture the flag,
or a moderately violent hide-and-seek variant we called Man Hunt.
My favorite thing was what I called "Flee-running". If you're
familiar with Free Running or Parkour, it's more in line with the
latter. It wasn't about flourishes, but rather about getting from
point A to point B as efficiently as possible. The only difference
was, you were being chased. It's a combination of tag & parkour
usually played deep in the woods, often in the dark. It's skill
based only so much as it takes a lot of skill not to stop running
when you take a branch to the face in the middle of the night. It
was so thrilling, though. I've lept from cabin roofs, tarzan'd
across creeks, and jumped through windows. So dangerous, and so
fun.

We also had really stupid high school games. There's one that
I picked up on in college that started from a friend's high school
time. It's really simple, if someone says the word "bogwan" you
have to freeze exactly where you are in the position you're in for
thirty seconds. If it's dangerous or whatever, then you don't...
but once you're clear of danger you have to freeze. It was mostly
used to emphasize some stupid expression you were making at the
time. Make some embarrasing face and you're bound to be bogwan'd.
It's still active and on rare occasion I'll get a bogwan text from
that crew.

There's so many other stupid games from that time. A lot of them
involve getting punched in the balls, for some reason. High school
again, I guess.

Board games are coming back into my life again which is great.
I've got one RPG going and will likely run a Numenera game
sometime in the next year. I'm doing a retro-gaming playthrough of
the complete Zelda franchise and occasionally twitch stream it.
I'm 8bitino on Twitch, but I rarely go on. I'm about halfway
through Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. It's hard! Next up will
be the Game Boy games, and I'm really excited.

I also am in a slow retro-playthrough of the Quest for Glory
series. I rocked QFG1 in style on Twitch not too long ago. I have
my saved character for QFG2, but I'm going to restart it now that
I found a VGA version. The most exciting thing about this
playthrough is that I've never played QFG5. I stopped at #4 and
loved it so much, but 5 came out after I'd moved on to other
things. EEEk, so much fun!

In a future post I'd like to cover off on some of the RPG
campaigns I've run in the past. The Assassini is probably my best
one, so I think I'll start there. 

Assassini

Setting: 1716 Paris 

Mission: Two agents of the Catholic Church, armed with Papal
dispensation, have been dispatched to undermine the political
power in the region, uncover a religious mystery, and combat
agents of the British Crown who seek to disrupt their plans.
