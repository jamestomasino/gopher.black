repair
February 03rd, 2020
----------------------------------------

Jan posted recently [0] about the awesomeness of fixing stuff. It
was timely for me since I've been on a bit of a repair renaissance
here. 

[0] jan - on fixing stuff
    gopher://jan.bio/1/phlog/20200131-on-fixing-stuff

When we moved to Iceland I knew it was going to be problematic
finding some things, especially specialty parts and quality goods.
In the midst of that dawning situation I was also staring at my
hobbies filling multiple rooms, offices, the basement and garage.
We were moving from a very large 5-bedroom home to a cozy
apartment. If I wanted to keep active on a hobby, I thought, then
it should serve a purpose and fit in our space.

I love waterproof, locking, stackable containers. I have a bunch
of the 20 gallon ones that we use in the move and in storage (no
worries about flooding!). I have smaller ones that stack and sit
on an industrial metal shelf beside my office desk. In each of
these containers is a hobby. That's the space I give them,
generally. Flutes all fit in one with the music books. All my
electronics fit in another. All my spinning tools, accessories,
and fiber in a 3rd (the wheel itself is a special exception). Our
hand-tools and sharpening stones fit in a 4th. Everything in its
place.

I also debated on bringing my 3D printer to Iceland since it
seemed extraneous and extravagant, but later decided it would be
useful to 3-D print parts that were hard to source in-country.

So now that I've been living with this stuff for 7 months, how is
it working? Well, I've done more sewing by hand here in Iceland
than I did at home with a machine and a full room dedicated to it.
I'm constantly repairing the kid's clothes, creating stuffed
animals, toys, sleeves for tools, and so on. I 3D printed sturdy
handles for our shopping bags since we walk to-and-from the market
a kilometer twice a week. My wife's chromebook's touchpad stopped
working this week and I opened it all up, cleaned everything,
re-seated leads, and it's like new. I'm even spinning wool
regularly now!

Maintaining things is a joy. Fixing them up and not wasting money
on new things means more freedom from work. We can subsist on
lower incomes and spend more time enjoying life this way. The
world has less waste. My hobbyist yearnings are itched. Life is
good.

Now if I could find a reliable tabletop RPG group, life would be
perfect!

  <title>A Film A Day And Other Mental Magic</title>

A Film A Day and other mental magic
January 16th, 2020
----------------------------------------

In the early days of the web I had a site called A Film A Day.
Why, oh, why, did the Internet Archive fail to archive it, I shall
never know. For about 5 years I kept up a practice of watching (on
average) one film per day and reviewing it. Of course I didn't
watch something every single day, so I'd bank by watching a few on
the weekends and so on. The important part wasn't getting my
yearly quota, though. I was on a mission to prove a point in an
argument I'd had at a diner.

                      Every movie is a
                      five star movie
                      if you watch it
                      the right way.

That was my angle, you see. My reviews weren't about giving
ratings to the films. It was all about figuring out how to watch
them to get the most enjoyment. I managed it, too! with a few
notable exceptions (no one can get 5 stars from Battlefield
Earth).

You need an example? Let's take the unfortunate film, Alien Vs.
Predator. What should have been a bloody affair was hamstrung by
a PG-13 rating and a setting so isolated in the arctic that
nothing really felt at stake. But... twist it in your mind and let
it become the greatest video game trailer of all time and entire
story now has purpose and drive.

Sometimes that's all it takes. Just tweak your mind a little bit
and see things from another angle and it's awesome! Other times it
takes much more work. 

I've been thinking on the Star Wars films and how I might approach
them so they're enjoyable. I think the best angle might be through
compassion. I imagine the filmmakers as a kid in high school who
adores this fandom. He eats up everything he can about the
theories and fan-fiction. He lives his life so deep in it that he
forgets there are casual fans. There are people who watched the
movies once and then moved on. There is no place left in his world
that hasn't been taken over with esoteric knowledge of this
imagined universe.

We feel a little sorry for that kid and wish he could enjoy
something else, something more. But we know, also, that he gets
such joy from this that we feel for him and want him to experience
it where he can.

And so, these other Star Wars movies are his. They are not part of
the series. They are not "real". The universe bestowed a gift upon
that nerd and let him use real actors and studios to produce his
opus of fandom. It is filled with false nostalgia and fan theories
jumbled up into a hodgepodge. It is not there to make sense. It is
not there to complete a great epic. It is a fulfillment of
a nerd's dream, and we can compassionately enjoy it with him.

  <title>Resolution</title>

Resolution
January 01st, 2020
----------------------------------------

I've got a little history [0,1] of making new years resolution
posts on this phlog. I suppose I'll continue the trend. Three
years in a row makes it a tradition, wouldn't you say?

[0] Resolution (2018)
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20180101-resolution
[1] Resolution (2019)
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20181225-resolutions

In 2018 I resolved that I'd try to avoid time traps and spend time
on things that matter. I picked up a few new hobbies and did
pretty well with the effort. In 2019 I taught the phlogosphere
about my buddy's ridiculous resolutions and said that it would be
the year I was impeached. While I didn't manage to get impeached,
at least someone did.

This year I haven't really been thinking about it much, so as the
fireworks go BANG in the background I'll do some real-time
pondering. Perhaps it might be a good opportunity to affect some
sort of ridiculous word usage, like 'whilst' or 'whomst'. That's
pretty saucy, but is it resolution material? What about something
more serious and purposeful, like de-googling completely. But one
of my contract gigs uses Google apps for everything, so that's
probably out. I could pick one of my hobbies, like yarn spinning,
and set a public goal. That might be good.

I should probably start with the silliness, though. Those come to
me more easily anyway. Lets see... what's something that would be
impossible for me but is definitely attainable by SOMEONE. Hmmm...
I've got it!

2020 will be the year Taylor Swift releases an album featuring ME!

Perfect. I'll just practice my hip-hop stylings by singing my own
name over the start of her songs. This is gonna be bangin'.

As for a real resolution, I could stand to burn some weight, pray
more, eat better, walk more. That's all a constant goal, though.
It doesn't need a special new year kickoff.

I think 2020 will borrow some sentiment from 2018 and a bit from
Dune. This will be the year of my Butlerian Jihad, if you will.
I don't want the computer to be my default place to hang out. As
much as I love you guys, it's an easy trap for me here in Iceland.
I don't need to work to inculturate, practice my language skills,
or any of that jazz. I am instantly connected to everyone and it's
too easy to let that fill my day.

So there it is, my 2020 Resolution is "Thou shalt not make
a machine in the likeness of a human mind". In this case I'll use
a (very) liberal interpretation of that to mean my own mind shall
not be trapped by machines. (Yeah, yeah, I know that's not what it
means. Shuddup!)

Never fear, dear gopherites. I still work on the computer and will
surely be around plenty even with this goal. It's inevitable.

  <title>Webmentions And Microsub</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20191223-webmentions-and-microsub/</link>

  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
----------------------------------------
webmentions and microsub
December 23rd, 2019
----------------------------------------

This phlog is about web stuff. Specifically it's about Indyweb
things and microformats.

I use my website https://tomasino.org as an IndieAuth [0] portal.
When logging into sites that understand the IndieWeb concept,
I provide my "Home" URL as an identifier. Then the site scrubs
through all the various links I have on that page and picks out
those that it can understand for authentication. In most cases
I get GPG and GitHub hits, though occasionally a site will support
more. I oAuth in, and bam... identified. It's pretty neat and
requires very little effort on my side.

[0] IndieAuth
    https://indieauth.com/

There are much fancier IndieWeb doodads though, and I wanted to
start taking advantage of some. In particular Webmentions had
drawn my attention. It's a different way to handle commenting
that, honestly, reminds me of what we do here in gopherspace.
Instead of leaving a comment on a post somewhere, you just write
your own blog post and "notify" the original. The original page
can then choose whether to add a link to yours or ignore it or
whatever. Everyone maintains control of their own words and all is
well!

So I opened up the IndieWeb sites and went digging into
Webmentions [1]. I was immediately reminded why I abandonded this
the last time around. While the concept is incredibly simple, the
implementation is annoyingly complex and the terminology for
things is as bad as git [2].

[1] Webmentions
    https://webmention.net/
[2] Git Man Page Generator
    https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/

Since my sites are all static I wasn't looking for a plugin or
even something that automatically displayed anything on the
front-end at all. I just wanted something to process webmentions
and give me a way to see that they happened. For my low traffic
sites, a Webmention-to-Email system would have been perfect.

There are a number of things out there already. Some support the
Webmention client role and others the server because--did I not
mention this?--you need webmentions set up on both sides for it to
work. So to actually do it you need reading, writing, discovery
and parsing. There are a handful of projects doing the various
points and most of them are "in development" to varying degrees.
Almost all of them have complex esoteric documentation that only
makes sense if you're already familiar with the protocol enough to
write your own software. Lovely!

There are a few 3rd party services that offer the basics without
charge. I don't know if they work or not, but that's what I ended
up trying. I really don't want to spend the whole Christmas break
figuring this stuff out. I don't expect to get many, if any,
mentions anyway. Webmention.io is the service I went with. I used
IndieAuth to log in and then grabbed the links it gave me to paste
on my various blogs. I have no idea how to "use" Webmentions from
the other side, and no idea how to test if I'm set up correctly.

I wonder if I need to IndieAuth with the blog URL itself and then
use webmention.io directly to that property only and then repeat
the process for the other site. It says I should be able to use it
on many sites though, so hopefully it's fine. Time will tell.

Webmention.io provides a microformat feed of the mentions you
receive. I was going to grab the RSS one and plug it into my RSS
reader until I noticed the mention of this other IndieWeb format,
Microsub.

Oh joy! Another one. :D

Microsub seems like an abstraction layer above microformats that
can be interpretted as feeds or notifications. RSS and Atom are
valid inputs, but so are other bits. Like other IndieWeb things,
there's a big push to separate client & servers. In this case
I found Aperture [3] as a server and I'm using a couple different
clients to see the front-end.

[3] Aperture
    https://aperture.p3k.io/

Most of these projects are also "in development", but they seem
functional enough that I was able to dupe my tt-rss contents over.
As I mentioned in my last post [4], I'm looking for a replacement
for that software anyway so maybe this will work out.

[4] Poisoning the Well
    gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20191216-poisoning-the-well

Eventually I'd like to run all these services myself (though
I have no desire to write the software to do so myself). I have
nginx running on this webserver already so if I can dockerize the
bits & pieces together into an IndieWeb multi-container and
reverse proxy everything that would be perfect. For now I'm
putting a pin in it. Things are good enough.

Are any of you running IndieWeb goodness? Have thoughts or
suggestions? Wanna vent? Send me a mention in the lovely gopher
style!

poisoning the well
December 16th, 2019
----------------------------------------

This week I learned that the RSS aggregator I use, tt-rss, is
developed by an individual whose personal politics are at odds
with my own. This morning I became aware that the creator of the
television show, The IT Crowd, appears to be a scumbag. If we look
back over the last year or two it's easy to spot Chik Fil A and
Harvey Weinstein and a hundred other cases where a person or
organization has become pariah. Their works are stained forever.

A number of questions came to me after considering our present
reality:

  - Is it universal? Does the idea of individual moral judgement
    apply the same way to all people? What about companies?
  - Is this new? Is it a continuous development from some earlier
    state?
  - Is it "fair", not to the subject of the moral judgement, but
    to the works? What about collective works where only a single
    contributor is a problem? Does their position of authority
    change the judgement?

There's too much to go into in a gopher phlog. I'm not going to
write some massive moral treatise here. There's really two bits
I'm focused on anyway, so pitter-patter, as they say…

First is the question of large collective works, like film.
According to some web page I read in passing, which queried data
from the top IMDB films, the average crew on a film is about 588
members strong. If we assume that the moral distribution of
individuals on a given film is representative of the general
population (safe enough, not given a specific film) then we might
expect some sort of normal distribution of morality (if such
a thing were quantifiable). If one of these individuals were to
score at an extreme to one degree or another it will not shift the
distribution noticeably. The overall morality of those making this
piece of collective art is unchanged.

But we punish them, don't we? Many of us will boycott the movie
because of what that actor said, or what the director did. We will
spite the 587 others on a film for that one person. They have, in
effect, poisoned the well. 

But maybe it's not about the math of morality. Maybe it's because
we must take action in the face of injustice. Something we
perceive as wrong cannot be allowed to occur, even if our methods
will cause harm to others. That sounds silly, doesn't it? It does
to me.

Maybe it matters more when justice would not be done without the
masses acting in protest. If the courts won't prosecute, then the
voice of the consumer will blacklist them. Let capitalism rear its
power for justice for once, right?

Ultimately I think it's harder to let go of something we see as
wrong than it is to ignore the damage we cause others. Collateral
damage is a shame, but at least we got THAT guy.

So yeah, there's some moral ambiguity here in collective works,
but what about individual creators? Should everyone boycott
tt-rss? Should we avoid using suckless code? Stop listening to
somebody's music? Maybe that's easier here. After all, we're not
hurting anyone else with this sort of mob justice.

There's just so many "what ifs" floating around. What if the
despicable person created something that helps people? What if
they pioneered a green energy revolution? What if they found
a disease cure? What if they make a really good software package
for the blind?

Yes, on the one hand it is the old debate about whether you can
separate art from artist. But there's the question of utility as
well. At what point does the good of the work outweigh the bad of
the individual.

This is where my head has been all morning and I'm not coming up
with any concrete answers. That's probably a sign that I shouldn't
expect a fixed set of rules to apply. In the case of films, I'll
probably keep seeing them. In the case of tt-rss, I will probably
jump to another project if I find one comparable. In the case of
the IT Crowd, I'll continue to quote and enjoy it and probably use
that moment to also inform others around me that Graham Linehan as
a shitbag. Double-win, right?

  <title>Years Of Journaling</title>

years of journaling
December 15th, 2019
----------------------------------------

A few of you brilliant gopherites have been talking about the
length of time they've been blogging [0,1]. 20 years is a lot of
blog posts whether collected on the web or gopher. It's great to
see collections like this all together surviving so long.

[0] It was 20 years ago today
    gopher://gopher.conman.org/0Phlog:2019/12/04.1
[1] On 16 years of blogging
    gopher://republic.circumlunar.space/0/~slugmax/phlog/2019-12-13-on-16-years-of-blogging

I've had people go spelunking down into my own blog [2] archives
before and I have to say it's a really cool feeling. Journaling is
inherently about yourself. When another human decides to spend
their time reading your personal thoughts and history, it's very
flattering (at least to me).

[2] tomasino blog
    https://blog.tomasino.org

There are technical blogs aplenty which focus on code or math or
science or whatever topic that isn't the self. They're great too,
but I don't see them the same way. I'm sure they provide great
interest to people when they're published, and interesting history
to those that come later. Sharing a personal blog is so much more
intimate. Keeping one up for an extended period of time is its own
type of vulnerability. It's not just showing your timely thoughts
of today, but also the cringe-worthy worries of younger you. It's
easy to spotlight the mistakes, the lack of understanding, and the
ideas that you'd eventually grow out of. That's beautiful stuff,
if horribly embarrassing.

I started journaling when I was 14. I have a shelf of paper
journals sitting over there --> that I flip through still. I still
do some paper journaling these days, too. Those moleskines aren't
going to fill themselves, after all.

It wasn't until 1998 that I started writing a blog online. I was
off to college and learning how to do all this crazy web stuff.
I kept text notes on that website for a while (lost now even to
the wayback machine, sadly). I later moved to livejournal and kept
a pretty decent journal there with a ring of friends. Thankfully
I harvested some of those old posts before nuking my livejournal
account years later. Those earliest posts on my blog now were
written there. They've been updated a few times to move to
wordpress, jekyll, and now hugo. I keep that stuff in git now,
too. Better peace of mind, for sure.

Anyway, I don't have much more to say on the subject. It's pretty
cool that I've almost got 20 years of journaling history up on the
internet myself. I hope I have much more to offer down the line in
gopher as well.

sdf minecraft question
November 15th, 2019
----------------------------------------

My son is 7 years old and has been playing minecraft on his iPad
for the last few months. We don't have him on any servers yet, and
he's been mostly playing in creative mode. I suspect in the near
future he's going to want to try to move online to a server.
I just saw xiled and tfurrows mention they're on the SDF minecraft
server, so I thought I'd check in on whether it's a good spot for
a kid to join safely. I know the tildeverse has one as well, but
they play a little looser with things there. If SDF is a good
place I'd feel better about having him try it out sometime.

re: gopher resiliency
November 15th, 2019
----------------------------------------

The illustrious tfurrows recently wrote [0] on the topic of
resiliency of his gopher content. He brings up a familiar topic
and one tangentially related to the recently popular "right to be
forgotten" vs "archival" debates.

[0] tfurrows - gopher resiliency
    gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~tfurrows/phlog/2019-11-14_gopherResiliency.txt

I think I have something to say on the subject, but I started this
reply before I thought everything out. Lets see what comes up as
I go…

When I was a boy I had a cabinet in by bedroom. At some point in
time, for Christmas, I got my very own TV that sat on top of it.
Inside, at a later Christmas, I was able to add my Nintendo
Entertainment System and a few games. A bit later the cabinet
would welcome the introduction of some new controllers and my
first issue of Nintendo Power Magazine. The magazines grew quickly
from one to 10 to 40 until they took up most of the cabinet space.
At some point or another my subscription ended, though I couldn't
say when or why exactly. I grew up, my interests changed. I was on
BBSes and Prodigy all day instead of trying futilely to beat
Battle Toads. The cabinet door closed one day an didn't open again
for a very long time.

When it did open, I was older and with wildly different interests.
The NES still had its charm, so it came out of the cabinet and
journeyed with me to college and beyond. The magazines, though,
stayed on the shelf. Another decade passed and it was time to
empty out the cabinet from my parents' home as they planned their
retirement move. I cracked open the doors and there they were. In
a moment of nostalgia, I flipped through some pages. The air
filled with a familiar smell that transported me back to a time
when these characters, interviews, reviews and comics were vibrant
and new. I was 9 years old again and filled with joy for a moment.

But I wasn't there to take a massive collection of magazines with
me. I was there to empty out the trash, to toss it and let it go.
I put those magazines in an empty box that once held printer
paper, scribbled a label and tossed in in the car. I wasn't going
to keep them, but I wasn't ready for them to disappear just yet
either.

The box sat under my desk in my house for another couple years
totally forgotten until a friend's son developed a magical
infatuation with Mario that can only come with youth. He dressed
as Mario, got every toy Mario imaginable, and even enjoyed playing
the old games on his dad's emulator. One day the little guy got
quite the surprise when a giant box showed up on his table. He
looked inside, pulled out a magazine and started flipping through.
His eyes lit up when he saw that it was filled with Mario and all
the other familiar characters he loved.

He couldn't care less about game strategy guides for a system he
didn't have, but he loved the comic stories and the artwork. We
gave him some scissors and chopped them up to make new artwork.
His mom is an elementary school art teacher, so resources were
readily available. He made some really great stuff from those
dusty pages.

This came to mind as I was thinking about resiliency and I wanted
to share even if I couldn't articulate it perfectly. I guess it's
about the meaning of art in a way. Some argue that an artist (or
writer) has an intention with their work and that is the value.
Their intended sharing of an idea or experience is the art. Others
say that the experience of the viewer or reader is what matters.
I think there's enough value for both to be true.

When I write a phlog post or share some experiment on gopher I get
satisfaction from sharing my thoughts or notes or otherwise
contributing to the little quiet space we have carved out. I also
get joy knowing that you all read it. Over the years I've seen
first-hand how the things I've shared have landed with some of you
in an unintended way. Maybe they've inspired a response, or
reminded you of a long forgotten hobby. Maybe a silly project
I started and gave up on had a clue to something you were
struggling with. But there's more than the immediate effect.

I've run across old gopher content from the 90s detailing
conferences, meet-ups, and stories that are otherwise unknown to
me. I can witness snapshots in time as someone tried to puzzle out
the future of the internet, not knowing what was about to blow up
around them. Their goals of communication have little to do with
the experience I now have in reading. Instead of learning about
possible futures I get a glimpse of human struggle against the
unknown, teamwork and camaraderie. I get to see the problems of
the day in a way that's hard from this vantage. I get to remember
my own early internet days and pick out pieces of history. And
that's just from some gopher history [1]. How much more exciting
is it when I find old code or diaries.

Resiliency conjures up this idea that our writing is somehow
either indelible or written in disappearing ink. Some people will
assuredly make the choice to nuke their archives and skip out on
gopher or the web or whatever. Some will have hardware failures or
platforms will go away. Others will surely continue to archive.
Cameron Kaiser will continue his efforts, or others will rise up
and do the same, and much of this will survive in someone's text
archives. Others will come and go from places like SDF, leaving
behind a few postings and files before forgetting their account
exists. tfurrows has four cosmic posts [2] and five more secret
gopher postings [3] that link up a really cool and interesting
science fiction story. If that story doesn't continue then it
still exists as part of the shared universe. It adds to the vibe
and contributes in itself.

Perhaps one day in the distant future our silly thoughts and ideas
will be gathered together, chopped up, and turned into something
new and unexpected. Maybe we'll all sit in a virtual cabinet for
decades first. Maybe some of it will fade away or be lost, but
I think there's a good chance for resiliency. Our stuff is mostly
text, after all, and that doesn't take up much space.

----------------------------------------
NaNoWriMo 2019
October 31st, 2019
----------------------------------------

This year I'm going to participate in my own way in NaNoWriMo [0].
I will not be attempting a whole novel or even their on-pace daily
word count. It's not for me, though I wish I were that prolific.
No, instead I will be working on finishing some things. 

[0] NaNoWriMo
    https://www.nanowrimo.org/

First up: Emergence [1]

This is a speculative fiction about the birth of an AI that
I began a while back. I enjoyed some good progress on it and have
been satisfied reading back and what came out (rare). Sadly, it
fell off my priority list and has been sitting there begging for
some love.

Since this is only a short story, it's not the same level of
investment required as a whole novel. I've already got some good
development in place and notes on where I want it to go. Time to
finish it!

Next: Trobairitz [2]

Over on Cosmic Voyage [3] I have a new "ship" in planning. This
one is actually an interstellar group of women storytellers who
are hired to share the stories from various cultures. The format
for it will be very different than we've seen so far on Cosmic in
that each post is a complete, self-contained story.

The first story that will be published is related to the Oleander
[4] storyline, and shows a bit of the aftermath of that mission.
I hope to have that first post done in November as well.

[4] Oleander

Finally: Melchizedek [5]

If you're following along in my main Cosmic Voyage storyline
you'll know that something pretty weird just went down. As excited
as I am to explore that, there's a bit of a time delay involved.
So instead I need to switch my focus back to the other crew
sitting on the planets around Beta Hydri. It's always a joy to
write Stephanie Janssen, so she'll probably get another log next,
but there's also an ignored plotline I need to chip away at on
planet 4 with Hildar Simms. The poor guy has spent 90 days in
quarantine! Now that he's out, fun gets to begin.

[5] Melchizedek
    gopher://cosmic.voyage/1/ships/Melchizedek

I don't know that I'll get the to all this before the month ends,
though. We have our first visitors coming around the 20th. They'll
be staying with us until December, so I only get about 2/3rds of
the month to write. I hope it's enough to finish Emergence at the
very least. That's the minimum bar I want to set for myself.

So what about you? Are any of you planning on doing anything
special for NaNoWriMo? Anyone actively following Melchizedek? Have
anything you're dying to read more about?
