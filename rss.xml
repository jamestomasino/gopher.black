Re: sysdharma - Gophercon
April 08th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I was so excited about the possibility of a gophercon when I saw
the first mention of Brazil. I was just as heartbroken when it
turned out (once again) to be about Go-lang. It drives me crazy
that they keep using "gopher" for everything. Fakes me out every
time. Boo.

Bitreich has something they do in Germany for gopher, but I'm not
sure what sort of attendance it gets or if it's more for their
private community. I'd love a real gopher (1436) conference, but
we regular users are far too spread out around the globe. I can't
imagine many people traveling across continents to attend. Maybe
a virtual thing? Do those work?

If we were to have a conference I think it should either be called
simply "1436con" or "Port 70". No confusion there. What sort of
things would happen at a conference for gopher? Ideas:

  - A talk or two on TLS and Gopher over Tor 
  - Panel discussion on the pros & cons of adding new ItemTypes
  - "To gophermap or not to gophermap, that is the question"
  - Social networking on legacy, minimal systems
  - Other sociological stuff about community
  - "Content is King"

What else?

Interactive Fiction
April 08th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I've been thinking about writing some interactive fiction, or at
least a choose-your-own-adventure story. I want to do it on gopher
using gophermaps, keeping it as simple as links at the end of each
section. Any suggestions for a subject, theme, genre? I don't want
to tackle anything too long since I'll have to write all the
different variations.

Have any of you done one of these before? I was going to plot it
out on notecards first and write the scenes from there. Is there
a better way?

Fat
April 07th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I keep track of my weight and a bunch of other measurements with
a little shell function that logs to a csv file on dropbox. A year
ago I made some fantastic progress but then it all fell apart.
With the new year I started getting back into my good habits and
once again was making progress. Last month I got really sick: flu,
pneumonia, blah blah. I fell off the wagon (a food wagon) and have
been eating like crap once again.

Tomorrow it's back on diet again (keto) and I know I'll feel so
much better soon. To help prep me mentally I decided to plot my
weight progress.

I've stripped off the axis info here cause you don't need to see
all that, but you can see from the shape of the data that it's
been a wild ride. I hope things go more smoothly this time. I'm
sick of being fat.

Side note: I generated that chart with an awesome command-line

The final command to generate that chart:

  awk -F "," '{print $1 "-" $2 "-" $3 "," $4}' weight.csv | \

Gopher Alert: Bob Alberti is here
April 06th, 2018

Bob Alberti [0] is now on SDF and has started a Phlog [1]. You
might remember him from a little thing called The Internet Gopher
Protocol RFC [2]. This is absolutely thrilling! Bob, if you see
this, welcome back to the land YOU built. I hope you enjoy the new
life that's being breathed back into it in our little corner.

The Bible
April 05th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Yesterday I added a new section to my gopher hole [0]. It's the
English Standard Version of the Bible, used with permission. I've
written a script to fetch books/chapters/verses on demand and used
it to prepopulate a full view of the Bible, chapter by chapter.
I'm pretty sure everything came in properly, but I'll be double
checking over the coming weeks.

My next step is to add some safeguards to the script and make it
work on demand as a cgi. There are limitations on how much can be
queried at once and such attached to the API, so I'll need to plan
accordingly. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, pop on over and give it a read. It's my favorite
translation: a literal one with modern grammar. I've opted to
suppress chapter & verse markings as well as footnotes and just
let the text live on its own. I think it makes things much more
reabable.

I've added a bunch of new people to my personal moku-pona list
lately. Thanks to tfurrows for mentioning c25l recently. I had no
idea (s)he was around and there's so much to read! Also, tfurrows,
since you have different phlogs on different gopher holes I've
added each of yours separately to my lists. Yargo too gets two
mentions. Anyone else running multiple phlogs that I should be
tracking?

  <title>A Warning To New Friends</title>

A warning to new friends
April 01st, 2018
----------------------------------------

Take a moment to compose yourself and disconnect from  the  moment
happening around you.

Think about your place in the world and let your mind slowly  zoom
out. Watch that place  become a spec and then  nothing  at  all as
your inward eye moves toward the infinite.

Now, with that distance and sense  of  impartiality  consider  for
a moment your own actions  to the people around you.  Think  about
what you consider good and  what leaves a  bitter  taste  in  your
mouth. Don't linger too long on any one thing, but try not to skip
over the shameful parts completely.

Everyone you meet today will face that person you  just  examined.
That person:  keep  the  idea  separate  from  yourself  for  now.

If a friend were to  encounter that person today,  what would  you
warn them about before the encounter? How would you guide them  to
a better relationship?

                              * * *

This was the meditation I did tonight. I thought some of you might
like to try it as well.

Quick poll:

Do you think I should keep using gophermaps for my phlog, or
should I move back to type 0 and include non-followable links as
text, like so [0].

  <title>This Old House</title>

This old house
March 31st, 2018
----------------------------------------

I'm standing in an empty room facing a large bow window stretching
from the rough wooden floor to a rounded arching top. There is
some dust and dirt in the corners and fallen between the floor
boards gapping slightly with age. To my right is a door to the
hallway and eventually roof access. Behind me a closet holds shoe
boxes of memories.

I know the layout of this place intimitely, though I've never
really been there. It doesn't really exist. In a sense it is my
memory palace [0]. In another sense, it is like the Hi'ngwikan of
the Lenape people and I am its a-la-pa-cte [1]. It is a private
place of prayer and solitude where I can organize my thoughts and
intentions.

I don't remember the first time I went there, but I do remember
that it started with that window. I can still count the panes of
glass, see the smudges of fingerprints I've left, note the
imperfections in the glass as it distorts my view. These details
give it permanence that I find vital. Knowing the texture of the
wood gives me a comfort that I need to let myself be free. It is
through that freedom that I find peace.

                           - - - - -

Earlier today vilmibm posted [2] about what home means to him, and
how he is able to find it digitally by just finding a quite space
and connecting to his familiar tools, music, and communities.
I love that sentiment. I have anxiety over the question of "where
is home" or "where are you from". I could probably blame the Roma
heritage but that feels like cheating. In reality, I just don't
associate a physical place with home at all. Though I might wish
an online community or my digital environment to become home like
vilmibm has found, I don't think that fits me either.

[2] vilmibm's feels (2018-03-30)
    gopher://tilde.town/0/~vilmibm/feels/20180330.txt

No, my home is a dusty old house with a big bow window that always
has a different view when I look through it. I know where I keep
the memories of relationships past (in that closet on the bottom
shelf in a white shoebox), and I know that when I get really sad
I need to go out onto the rooftop garden and greenhouse and let
the light pour into me. 

                           - - - - -

Tonight I felt some of that sadness coming on. At first I thought
it might mean I was going to have a good evening writing (it's
much easier for me to write when depressed) but I felt it take
a sour turn in my mind. So, instead of wallowing I spent a little
time in meditation and prayer in my little old house.  No sooner
had I sat on that dusty floor and placed my hands lightly on the
wooden slats when a cloud broke and a fresh beam of sunlight
warmed my cheek. Like everything in that place, the symbols speak
a language I understand intuitively. 

That sunlight is what I needed tonight. That's how my prayer
works.
