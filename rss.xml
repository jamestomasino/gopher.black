phlog listing updates
April 11th, 2019
----------------------------------------

It looks like tilde.town recently updated gophernicus, which is
awesome. Many of the servers out there running gophernicus leave
the bottom footer active for their users, which shows the current
gophernicus version that's running.

In my /etc/default/gophernicus I like to disable headers, footers
and the status page hidden at /server-status with the -nt -nh -nf
flags, like so:

OPTIONS="-o UTF-8 -nt -nh -nf -T 7070"

Part of my reasoning is aesthetic. I don't need to show extra crud
on gopher. Part of my reason is security. Not knowing which server
I'm running may make attacks on it more difficult. Not seeing IP
addresses of users engaged with my system helps them stay
anonymous (server-status related). And part of my reasoning is so
I don't accidentally trip up aggregators.

When you upgrade gophernicus and that version in the footer
changes, every aggregator out there suddenly thinks you made an
update to your phlog. This happens routinely on SDF and suddenly
every SDF member tracked on my moku-pona [0] sorts to the top of
the list. Today that happened for our tilde.town users.

Is it a big deal? Oh definitely not. Am I recommending others
running gophernicus use those switches? It's totally up to them
and I won't harp on the issue. I just want people to be aware that
it's a thing. I suspect many would choose to add the flags if they
knew about the situation, but I won't hold it against you if you
disagree, or simply don't care. Gopher is whatever the hell you
want to make it.

Speaking of gopher being whatever the hell you want to make it,
I was surprised to see Ze Libertine Gamer post recently that he
may be deleting his phlog [1]. That's a real shock, to be honest.
He's got some great content that goes back years. I wonder what
sort of things might lead someone to deleting a phlog but not the
entire gopher hole and I'm at a loss. I won't speculate here, but
I will say to ZLG, I really hope you keep it around, even if you
don't update very often. You've got some useful information you've
shared and have been a big part of the community. I'd certainly
miss your contributions.

To zcrayfish:

I agree. WebP does indeed suck. [2] Stop trying to make "fetch"
a thing, Google. Their sleasy method of inserting "switch to
modern image formats" into website performance checkers is dirty
and unwelcome. I don't like blackhat UI and I don't appreciate
their "disruptions".

Thanks to all of you who answered my silly three questions. I got
a lot of great movies to add to the playlist and I've been jamming
to your songs all week.

Keep gopherin' everyone!

Fun Questions
March 30th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I'm in a fun mood, so let's do something fun!

christyotwisty had a post on circumlunar not too long ago asking
users a bunch of reading questions. I'd link to it, but I can't
seem to find the phlog entry. Regardless, it was really fun and
got a lot of gopherspace engagement. I miss gopherspace
engagement! I want more. So, this is my blatant attempt to fish
interaction out of you all.

Who among you likes movies? How about music? Any readers? Good!
I was thinking of a nice, difficult challenge to throw your way.

1. Name one film that everyone should see at least once.
2. Name one book everyone should read at least TWICE.
3. Name one song everyone should listen to at least once a year.

Why those rules? Cause clickbait, baby!

Here's mine with no context:

1. Mary Poppins
2. Dune
3. Harry Chapin - Cat's in the Cradle

The Spam Files - Central Intellegence Agency
March 17th, 2019
----------------------------------------

This is a really interesting new spam/blackmail attempt that I
haven't seen before. I'm not sure exactly how it expects to be
effective being that it requires the individual to sort-of admit
to distribution and storage of child pornography. Hmmm...

Well, here it is, with only the email targeted redacted.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Case #47823596

Distribution and storage of pornographic electronic materials
involving underage children.

My name is Sharika Snell and I am a technical collection officer
working for Central Intelligence Agency.

It has come to my attention that your personal details including
your email address (<REDACTED>) are listed in case #47823596.

The following details are listed in the document's attachment:

    Your personal details,
    Home address,
    Work address,
    List of relatives and their contact information.

Case #47823596 is part of a large international operation set to
arrest more than 2000 individuals suspected of paedophilia in 27
countries.

The data which could be used to acquire your personal information:

    Your ISP web browsing history,
    DNS queries history and connection logs,
    Deep web .onion browsing and/or connection sharing,
    Online chat-room logs,
    Social media activity log.

The first arrests are scheduled for April 8, 2019.

Why am I contacting you ?

I read the documentation and I know you are a wealthy person who
may be concerned about reputation.

I am one of several people who have access to those documents and
I have enough security clearance to amend and remove your details
from this case. Here is my proposition.

Transfer exactly $10,000 USD (ten thousand dollars - about 2.5
BTC) through Bitcoin network to this special bitcoin address:

3CwcSdb9siP13NYpJ2Eck3dAfTAy3JCW1k

You can transfer funds with online bitcoin exchanges such as
Coinbase, Bitstamp or Coinmama. The deadline is March 27, 2019 (I
need few days to access and edit the files).

Upon confirming your transfer I will take care of all the files
linked to you and you can rest assured no one will bother you.

Please do not contact me. I will contact you and confirm only when
I see the valid transfer.

Regards,

Sharika Snell

I must be 30% magpie or something because I can't steer clear of
shiny new things no matter how hard I try. In this case, the shiny
"new" thing isn't so new at all, but is a programming language
from 1980 (when I was born). Ada [0] is a brilliant language. It's
incredibly simple, syntactically, but also extremely powerful. It
makes conscious decisions to forgo speed and brevity in exchange
for safety and clarity. It is cautious where other languages are
bold.

Here's a "hello, world" example:

with Ada.Text_IO;
procedure Hello is
  use Ada.Text_IO;
begin
  Put_Line("Hello, World!");
end Hello;

Everything is spelled out. Every instruction ends with
a semicolon, everything is case insensitive, variables must be
declared between the "is" and "begin" of a procedure. Every
beginning has an explicit end, which is labeled. It's so
ridiculously cautious!

I told ~ben the other day that it's the Tigran Petrosian [1] of
programming languages. The whole mentality is so neat to me.

There's a lot of languages out there and I don't need to learn
this one. While it's true that I haven't kept up with any
systems-programming languages it's not really a gap in my
knowledge. It's just that I have no need of them since I don't do
that type of work. So why learn something that's best suited to
massive government builds? Cause FUCK YOU, I wanna!

Look forward to seeing a bunch of shell work done in Ada in the
near future. I was going to make Cosmic Voyage's web generation
script in python instead of continuing to grow the massive /bin/sh
script, but maybe I'll tackle it in Ada instead.

Has anyone out there ever used it for web programming before? That
tickles me pink!

Anywho, any of you know and use Ada? I learned the basics in
college but have never done anything worth a damn in it. I found
a bunch of resources online including a standards site with the
most Orwellian name ever: Ada Conformity Assessment Authority [2].
Hah! So badass. They're serious about following conventions with
it, which really makes sense for the applications it serves. PEP8
is similar for python. If you feel like diving in with me, here's
a link to a crash-course in the form of a ~40pg PDF [3]. I'm going
to store my practice programs and notes in a git repo [4].

Now, lets see if I can do this without cutting into my Icelandic
practice, or my writing on this phlog, or on Cosmic Voyage, or my
preparations for the upcoming move, or planning my wife's 50th
birthday party (SEEEECRET) or any of the other things that are
actually important which I should be focusing on instead.

  <title>Re Cdmnky Crazy Bugs</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190219-re-cdmnky-crazy-bugs/</link>
  <pubdate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubdate>
  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
----------------------------------------
re: cdmnky - crazy bugs
February 19th, 2019
----------------------------------------

Here's a couple techniques I've learned over the years to punch
those sassy bugs that just won't go away square in the face-hole.

1. Explain that part of the program bit by bit to someone
   unfamiliar with it. It can be someone else in your class, or on
   your team, or just someone you know. They don't need to be
   coders. Just explain to them the logic of what you're doing and
   walk them through that part out loud.

   Often this will reveal your mistake sideways. You'll probably
   catch yourself just before you say the next part out loud as
   you unconsciously see the disconnect between what you expected
   to see and what's there. It's frustrating that it works, but it
   does. 

   Don't let a full hour go by debugging a single issue without
   trying this.

2. Delete it and rewrite it.

   No, shut-up. Just do it. I don't care that it SHOULD work.
   I don't care that you're just going to type it again exactly
   like the first time. Do it. Right, effing, now.

   Does it work? Oh hells yes. Will it make you angry when it
   does? Fuck yes.

   Don't let half a day go by debugging a single issue without
   trying this.

3. Try to solve something else.

   Take a break and work on a different thing if you can. Put it
   out of your brain. Give a day to another project or subject or
   call in sick with the butt-flu. Get some distance.

   It's not as reliable a fix as the first two, but it can do the
   trick. This is great if your issues is on a side-project or
   hobby that's not under a pressing deadline. Go wind surfing, or
   try to research different types of furry sub-culture, or
   binge-watch the old MTV cartoon "Clone High" so I can make
   jokes that people will get.

Those are my big 3. Maybe some others out there have
recommendations for you as well?

  <title>On The Separation Of Artists From Their Art</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190218-on-the-separation-of-artists-from-their-art/</link>
  <pubdate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubdate>

On the separation of artists from their art
February 18th, 2019
----------------------------------------

A stray boost on Mastodon got me thinking about the value of works
by horrible people. Do we damn the works, the art, the music, the
films once we discover something damning about the creator which?
Do you separate the art from the artist and think of each as
distinct?

I generally try for separation and I'll explain why. For me it
comes down to four things:

 - Ownership of ideas
 - Compassion
 - Outrage
 - Pragmatism

The most complex idea floating around in my head has to do with
the idea of ownership of artistic works. Does an artist own their
creation? While one might quickly argue in the affirmative, that
is owing to a legal point of view. Ownership has a cognitive
influence on our relationship to ideas which goes beyond the
courts and governments and fits more squarely into cultural mores
and moral frameworks. How you react to someone else's pen might
vary wildly depending on your cultural upbringing, for instance.
Where are lines drawn? How firm are they? Is there a gray area?

Lets take a specific example of a disgraced artist and his body of
work: Bill Cosby and the Cosby Show. Given the vague nature of
ownership, it's easy to attribute something of that sort here.
Bill Cosby was the star of the Cosby Show, certainly, and while he
might now own the rights to it, he was fundamental in its
creation. Great!

But there's more to it. Hundreds and thousands of other people
contributed to the show as well. Just considering actors alone,
can we really dismiss the contributions of the other co-stars?
Some of the children literally spent their own childhoods
dedicated to that art. They have equal legal ownership of the
product, and clearly as much personal investment upon creation.

There's also the ancient idea that art is created for the people.
Even our copyright law and patent protections in the US are
designed to recoup the losses of research and development of the
idea, not to form some perpetual ownership of intellectual
property. That would be ridiculous! Ideas belong to the people!

So where is the line here? Is it gray? Do we grant the ultimate
position to Cosby because his name is on it? Certainly, if we
can't attribute it to him then we can't in good conscience dismiss
the art with the artist. If it's not his, then he has no impact on
it. If we find out that Bill Cosby went to a certain high school,
should we shun it? Should we shut it down? It's irrelevant, right?

It would also be a disservice to those others who were involved.
Do we punish them? It was their art as well.

But now we're approaching my second point: compassion. Let's
assume compassion for possible other artists (who may have
suffered from the disgraced artist!) is a given. Besides that
point is the subject of the artist. This part may not be popular
with everyone, but I think it's important to keep out hope for the
forgiveness of the asshole. This is a Christian ideal and one
I can't always live up to, but I think it's important to aim for.
If an artist is disgraced along with all their works then the
message to them and to everyone is that a horrible thing can
completely define you. Any other good you might have done is wiped
away as a result. What hope is there for redemption in that? What
lesson to bother trying? I try to have compassion for the artist
here by not throwing out their good works with the bad. Let their
reputation be damned. Let them suffer prison time if appropriate,
but don't throw away the good with the bad!

And that brings me to my third idea: outrage! Why the actual fuck
would I give up something I enjoy because the creator was a dick?
Why am I punishing myself for something that asshat did? Fuck
that! The Cosby Show is fucking brilliant and funny as hell. It's
still relevant and touching and a genuine joy. That selfish fucker
can go fuck-off to prison now and suffer for what he did, but he's
not taking Rudy from me.

Oh, and then there's pragmatism. I've been talking about the Cosby
Show up until now, but how about the douche-nozzle that invented
the transistor? Don't know about his brand of awful? [0] I'm not
about to give up using electronics because of some guy whose name
I don't really care to know. His ideas belong to the people. I'm
going to use stuff, watch stuff, listen to stuff, and while I may
on occasion also throw up a finger toward the heavens while doing
so, IMMA be me.

nerds in time
January 29th, 2019
----------------------------------------

Neckbeards.

Picture them.

Now stretch your mind out and encompass the skinny, unwashed
computer geek. Look yonder at the sea of goatees. Greasy hair,
ill-fitting t-shirts. Ahh, a modern knight walks by with his
sidearm-styled phone holter.

We can all recognize the stereotype from our own experiences. The
people of tech nerdom have a look. Of course it's not universal,
but the fact that you too can picture it so easily reveals some
truth there.

This post is not about stereotyping though. Take that rant
elsewhere. This post is about... well, time.

Think back 40 years and the nerds of today are still there. You
find them wearing slightly different things, but the connection is
clear. The goatee is a beard and the hair is longer. Or maybe it's
a button-up shirt with the top button fastened. 

But what happens when we go back further? What happens 100 years
ago? What about 1000 years?

What form did this person take back then? Was there a medieval
sorcerer of "Well, Actually..."? [0] Perhaps the reason Cato [1] was
such a dick was that he was a good, old-fashioned, nerd. He knew
better than all the idiots around him.

  <title>Lxd</title>
  <link>gopher://gopher.black/1/phlog/20190128-lxd/</link>
  <pubdate>Mon, 28 Jan 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubdate>
  <description><![CDATA[<pre>
----------------------------------------
lxd
January 28th, 2019
----------------------------------------

lxd and lxc are amazing. If you know what they are, skip this
paragraph. If not, they're sort of like Docker, but instead of
encapsulating your application, they encapsulate a system. They're
not as broad as a whole VM, and in reality they're not really
a "thing" at all. They're a collection of isolation tools built
nto Linux that makes it seem like you're running on a whole new
vm while sharing kernels and junk. Um, go read about it somewhere
else. There's some great material out there that will explain it
better than me.

The purpose if this phlog is to document my basic LXD setup. My
host system is Ubuntu 18.04 as of this article being written, but
t really doesn't matter. Most of my containers are built using
the latest stable Ubuntu, but that also doesn't really matter. My
goals are as follows:

- Be able to create and dispose of containers easily
- All containers, by default, allow me to ssh in using my keys
- I can ssh to the containers by their container name, not IP
- I can apply a 'gui' profile and make a container work with my
  native display
- I can apply a 'user' profile and make my container start with my
  dotfiles installed

Step 1: Install LXD

If it's not already installed, you can grab the snap package.


Step 2: Install ZFS

It's not necessary, but it performs better at start/stop
operations. If you install it, LXD will use it as the default.

Step 3: Configure LXD

$ sudo lxd init

Just say yes to the defaults.

Step 4: Edit the default profile

$ lxc profile edit default

  config:
    user.vendor-data: |
      #cloud-config
      package_upgrade: true
      packages:
        - build-essential
        - software-properties-common
      users:
        - name: ubuntu
          ssh-import-id: gh:jamestomasino
          shell: /bin/bash
  description: Default LXD profile
  devices:
    eth0:
      name: eth0
      nictype: bridged
      parent: lxdbr0
      type: nic
    root:
      path: /
      pool: zfs
      type: disk
  name: default
  used_by: []

The key here is the ssh-import-id to pull my keys down from
github. With that I can ssh in immediately instead of using the
lxc exec method to sudo in.

Step 5: Edit the gui profile

If you didn't install lxd via snap, you'll need to run this one liner:

$ echo "root:$UID:1" | sudo tee -a /etc/subuid /etc/subgid

  config:
    environment.DISPLAY: :0
    raw.idmap: both 1000 1000
    user.user-data: |
      #cloud-config
      runcmd:
        - 'sed -i "s/; enable-shm = yes/enable-shm = no/g" /etc/pulse/client.conf'

      source: /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
      type: disk
    mygpu:
      type: gpu
  name: gui
  used_by: []

This magic sauce will set up all the dependencies needed to
connect to my display when a gui app is run. I then SSH in with
export x11 enabled and all is well.

Step 6: Edit a user profile

This one involves a lot of runcmd: stuff in a row that points to
my dotfiles, installs other apt packages, does a little dance, and
ends up with a working environment for me to do some damage. I'll
spare you all.

Step 7: SSH

I want to be able to connect to lxd containers by name, not just
IP address. I'm going to set that bit up in a minute using dnsmasq
and systemd, but first lets look at my ~/.ssh/config to see what
goodness lies within:

Host *.lxd
StrictHostKeyChecking no
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
LogLevel QUIET
ForwardX11 yes
ForwardX11Trusted yes
User ubuntu
IdentityFile ~/some/really/cool/path/to/SECRETS

The host checking and host file bit, along with LogLevel mean you
won't get man-in-the-middle warnings if your container IP changes
one day from starting and stoping repeatedly. X11 forwarding there
for display. I use ubuntu containers, so I've attached the
username there as well.

Step 8: DNS

$ sudo vim /usr/local/bin/lxdhostdns_start.sh

  #!/bin/sh

  LXDINTERFACE=lxdbr0
  LXDDOMAIN=lxd
  LXDDNSIP=$(ip addr show lxdbr0 | grep -Po 'inet \K[\d.]+')

  /usr/bin/systemd-resolve --interface ${LXDINTERFACE} \
                           --set-dns "${LXDDNSIP}" \
                           --set-domain ${LXDDOMAIN}


$ sudo vim /usr/local/bin/lxdhostdns_stop.sh

  #!/bin/sh

  LXDINTERFACE=lxdbr0

  /usr/bin/systemd-resolve --interface ${LXDINTERFACE} --revert


$ sudo vim /lib/systemd/system/lxd-host-dns.service

  [Unit]
  Description=LXD host DNS service
  After=multi-user.target

  [Service]
  Type=simple
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lxdhostdns_start.sh
  RemainAfterExit=true
  ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/lxdhostdns_stop.sh
  StandardOutput=journal

  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target

$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl enable lxd-host-dns.service
$ sudo systemctl start lxd-host-dns.service

Boom. If you didn't answer defaults on lxd init, then your
nterface might not be lxdbr0 and you'll need to change stuff.

Step 9: Test it out

$ lxc launch ubuntu: test
$ lxc list # wait until you can see the IP to know it's ready
$ ssh test.lxd

If everything blew up it's because you're with me and that DNS
hackery works great to be able to ssh in, but it also breaks the
ability for your container to connect to anything else. For now
I'm disabling the DNS bit and sshing in via IP, or using the lxc
exec sudo stuff to connect. I'm watching this post [0] for
a comment response that will hopefully clarify that last bit.
