years of journaling
December 15th, 2019
----------------------------------------

A few of you brilliant gopherites have been talking about the
length of time they've been blogging [0,1]. 20 years is a lot of
blog posts whether collected on the web or gopher. It's great to
see collections like this all together surviving so long.

[0] It was 20 years ago today
    gopher://gopher.conman.org/0/Phlog:2019/12/04.1
[1] On 16 years of blogging
    gopher://republic.circumlunar.space/0/~slugmax/phlog/2019-12-13-on-16-years-of-blogging

I've had people go spelunking down into my own blog [2] archives
before and I have to say it's a really cool feeling. Journaling is
inherently about yourself. When another human decides to spend
their time reading your personal thoughts and history, it's very
flattering (at least to me).

[2] tomasino blog
    https://blog.tomasino.org

There are technical blogs aplenty which focus on code or math or
science or whatever topic that isn't the self. They're great too,
but I don't see them the same way. I'm sure they provide great
interest to people when they're published, and interesting history
to those that come later. Sharing a personal blog is so much more
intimate. Keeping one up for an extended period of time is its own
type of vulnerability. It's not just showing your timely thoughts
of today, but also the cringe-worthy worries of younger you. It's
easy to spotlight the mistakes, the lack of understanding, and the
ideas that you'd eventually grow out of. That's beautiful stuff,
if horribly embarrassing.

I started journaling when I was 14. I have a shelf of paper
journals sitting over there --> that I flip through still. I still
do some paper journaling these days, too. Those moleskines aren't
going to fill themselves, after all.

It wasn't until 1998 that I started writing a blog online. I was
off to college and learning how to do all this crazy web stuff.
I kept text notes on that website for a while (lost now even to
the wayback machine, sadly). I later moved to livejournal and kept
a pretty decent journal there with a ring of friends. Thankfully
I harvested some of those old posts before nuking my livejournal
account years later. Those earliest posts on my blog now were
written there. They've been updated a few times to move to
wordpress, jekyll, and now hugo. I keep that stuff in git now,
too. Better peace of mind, for sure.

Anyway, I don't have much more to say on the subject. It's pretty
cool that I've almost got 20 years of journaling history up on the
internet myself. I hope I have much more to offer down the line in
gopher as well.

sdf minecraft question
November 15th, 2019
----------------------------------------

My son is 7 years old and has been playing minecraft on his iPad
for the last few months. We don't have him on any servers yet, and
he's been mostly playing in creative mode. I suspect in the near
future he's going to want to try to move online to a server.
I just saw xiled and tfurrows mention they're on the SDF minecraft
server, so I thought I'd check in on whether it's a good spot for
a kid to join safely. I know the tildeverse has one as well, but
they play a little looser with things there. If SDF is a good
place I'd feel better about having him try it out sometime.

re: gopher resiliency
November 15th, 2019
----------------------------------------

The illustrious tfurrows recently wrote [0] on the topic of
resiliency of his gopher content. He brings up a familiar topic
and one tangentially related to the recently popular "right to be
forgotten" vs "archival" debates.

[0] tfurrows - gopher resiliency
    gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~tfurrows/phlog/2019-11-14_gopherResiliency.txt

I think I have something to say on the subject, but I started this
reply before I thought everything out. Lets see what comes up as
I go…

When I was a boy I had a cabinet in by bedroom. At some point in
time, for Christmas, I got my very own TV that sat on top of it.
Inside, at a later Christmas, I was able to add my Nintendo
Entertainment System and a few games. A bit later the cabinet
would welcome the introduction of some new controllers and my
first issue of Nintendo Power Magazine. The magazines grew quickly
from one to 10 to 40 until they took up most of the cabinet space.
At some point or another my subscription ended, though I couldn't
say when or why exactly. I grew up, my interests changed. I was on
BBSes and Prodigy all day instead of trying futilely to beat
Battle Toads. The cabinet door closed one day an didn't open again
for a very long time.

When it did open, I was older and with wildly different interests.
The NES still had its charm, so it came out of the cabinet and
journeyed with me to college and beyond. The magazines, though,
stayed on the shelf. Another decade passed and it was time to
empty out the cabinet from my parents' home as they planned their
retirement move. I cracked open the doors and there they were. In
a moment of nostalgia, I flipped through some pages. The air
filled with a familiar smell that transported me back to a time
when these characters, interviews, reviews and comics were vibrant
and new. I was 9 years old again and filled with joy for a moment.

But I wasn't there to take a massive collection of magazines with
me. I was there to empty out the trash, to toss it and let it go.
I put those magazines in an empty box that once held printer
paper, scribbled a label and tossed in in the car. I wasn't going
to keep them, but I wasn't ready for them to disappear just yet
either.

The box sat under my desk in my house for another couple years
totally forgotten until a friend's son developed a magical
infatuation with Mario that can only come with youth. He dressed
as Mario, got every toy Mario imaginable, and even enjoyed playing
the old games on his dad's emulator. One day the little guy got
quite the surprise when a giant box showed up on his table. He
looked inside, pulled out a magazine and started flipping through.
His eyes lit up when he saw that it was filled with Mario and all
the other familiar characters he loved.

He couldn't care less about game strategy guides for a system he
didn't have, but he loved the comic stories and the artwork. We
gave him some scissors and chopped them up to make new artwork.
His mom is an elementary school art teacher, so resources were
readily available. He made some really great stuff from those
dusty pages.

This came to mind as I was thinking about resiliency and I wanted
to share even if I couldn't articulate it perfectly. I guess it's
about the meaning of art in a way. Some argue that an artist (or
writer) has an intention with their work and that is the value.
Their intended sharing of an idea or experience is the art. Others
say that the experience of the viewer or reader is what matters.
I think there's enough value for both to be true.

When I write a phlog post or share some experiment on gopher I get
satisfaction from sharing my thoughts or notes or otherwise
contributing to the little quiet space we have carved out. I also
get joy knowing that you all read it. Over the years I've seen
first-hand how the things I've shared have landed with some of you
in an unintended way. Maybe they've inspired a response, or
reminded you of a long forgotten hobby. Maybe a silly project
I started and gave up on had a clue to something you were
struggling with. But there's more than the immediate effect.

I've run across old gopher content from the 90s detailing
conferences, meet-ups, and stories that are otherwise unknown to
me. I can witness snapshots in time as someone tried to puzzle out
the future of the internet, not knowing what was about to blow up
around them. Their goals of communication have little to do with
the experience I now have in reading. Instead of learning about
possible futures I get a glimpse of human struggle against the
unknown, teamwork and camaraderie. I get to see the problems of
the day in a way that's hard from this vantage. I get to remember
my own early internet days and pick out pieces of history. And
that's just from some gopher history [1]. How much more exciting
is it when I find old code or diaries.

[1] gopher history archives
    gopher://gopher.black/1/archive/gopher-history

Resiliency conjures up this idea that our writing is somehow
either indelible or written in disappearing ink. Some people will
assuredly make the choice to nuke their archives and skip out on
gopher or the web or whatever. Some will have hardware failures or
platforms will go away. Others will surely continue to archive.
Cameron Kaiser will continue his efforts, or others will rise up
and do the same, and much of this will survive in someone's text
archives. Others will come and go from places like SDF, leaving
behind a few postings and files before forgetting their account
exists. tfurrows has four cosmic posts [2] and five more secret
gopher postings [3] that link up a really cool and interesting
science fiction story. If that story doesn't continue then it
still exists as part of the shared universe. It adds to the vibe
and contributes in itself.

[2] Xero Carbon Wells
    gopher://cosmic.voyage/1/ships/Xero Carbon Wells
[3] Wells' Carbon Clique
    gopher://167.88.113.62/1/~wells

Perhaps one day in the distant future our silly thoughts and ideas
will be gathered together, chopped up, and turned into something
new and unexpected. Maybe we'll all sit in a virtual cabinet for
decades first. Maybe some of it will fade away or be lost, but
I think there's a good chance for resiliency. Our stuff is mostly
text, after all, and that doesn't take up much space.

NaNoWriMo 2019
October 31st, 2019
----------------------------------------

This year I'm going to participate in my own way in NaNoWriMo [0].
I will not be attempting a whole novel or even their on-pace daily
word count. It's not for me, though I wish I were that prolific.
No, instead I will be working on finishing some things. 

[0] NaNoWriMo
    https://www.nanowrimo.org/

First up: Emergence [1]

This is a speculative fiction about the birth of an AI that
I began a while back. I enjoyed some good progress on it and have
been satisfied reading back and what came out (rare). Sadly, it
fell off my priority list and has been sitting there begging for
some love.

Since this is only a short story, it's not the same level of
investment required as a whole novel. I've already got some good
development in place and notes on where I want it to go. Time to
finish it!

[1] Emergence
    gopher://gopher.black/1/writing/emergence

Next: Trobairitz [2]

Over on Cosmic Voyage [3] I have a new "ship" in planning. This
one is actually an interstellar group of women storytellers who
are hired to share the stories from various cultures. The format
for it will be very different than we've seen so far on Cosmic in
that each post is a complete, self-contained story.

The first story that will be published is related to the Oleander
[4] storyline, and shows a bit of the aftermath of that mission.
I hope to have that first post done in November as well.

[2] Trobairitz
    gopher://cosmic.voyage/1/ships/Trobairitz
[3] Cosmic Voyage
    gopher://cosmic.voyage/1/
[4] Oleander
    gopher://cosmic.voyage/1/ships/Oleander

Finally: Melchizedek [5]

If you're following along in my main Cosmic Voyage storyline
you'll know that something pretty weird just went down. As excited
as I am to explore that, there's a bit of a time delay involved.
So instead I need to switch my focus back to the other crew
sitting on the planets around Beta Hydri. It's always a joy to
write Stephanie Janssen, so she'll probably get another log next,
but there's also an ignored plotline I need to chip away at on
planet 4 with Hildar Simms. The poor guy has spent 90 days in
quarantine! Now that he's out, fun gets to begin.

[5] Melchizedek
    gopher://cosmic.voyage/1/ships/Melchizedek

I don't know that I'll get the to all this before the month ends,
though. We have our first visitors coming around the 20th. They'll
be staying with us until December, so I only get about 2/3rds of
the month to write. I hope it's enough to finish Emergence at the
very least. That's the minimum bar I want to set for myself.

- - - - -

So what about you? Are any of you planning on doing anything
special for NaNoWriMo? Anyone actively following Melchizedek? Have
anything you're dying to read more about?

  <title>Living As An Rpg Textbooks</title>

Living as an RPG - Textbooks
September 28th, 2019
----------------------------------------

I think about my own life in terms of roleplaying games. I'm not
alone in this. I bet some of you reading do the same thing. When
I learn a new skill, I am totally thinking about it being added to
my character sheet as I draw a 1 in a little column. The skills
I choose to collect are probably a little skewed toward things
that are more useful in a fantasy adventure than in real life, but
that's not so bad. I once helped a friend get back into their
house when they locked themselves out, so who says lockpicking
isn't practical!

It's not just skills, though. I travel and move through life ready
to pounce on the newest quest that comes along. "Quests aren't
real," you say? Screw that jazz. You're just not looking hard
enough. When a ridiculous opportunity arises and you say yes,
BAM!, you're on a quest. Max out that XP and level up, my dudes.

For those of you who aren't quite ready to up-and-move to another
country, or join the military on a lark, or enter religious life,
or go live on a boat in the middle of a lake, or whatever, you can
still power-level by using some of the sweet loot available to you
at your local library. That's right, I'm talking about textbooks.

Simply read these magic tomes from the start to the end to add
a skill rank in whatever subject you desire. That's it! And it's
free! Maybe the library doesn't carry the subject you want and the
latest volume is like $7,000 at the campus bookstore... so get an
old version online for pennies. You think the information in Intro
to Physics has changed that much in 10 years?

When you're not in school anymore it might not occur to you that
you are still allowed access to textbooks. Just because it wasn't
assigned in a class doesn't mean you can't just pick it up on your
own. It doesn't have to be related to work, or a hobby, or
anything at all. Maybe you always sucked at math in school. Maybe
you can't remember the first thing about Algebra. If you want to
fix that, just get a textbook. Seriously. You're older, wiser, and
know how to apply your brain meats to stuff. Pick it up and start
at the beginning. The book will teach you. That's what it's for.
You won't have a teacher, so instead you'll have to,
I dunno...Google it. Hit up Khan Academy, or wikipedia, or bug
someone on a Tilde server. It's not hard. 

That's the secret of the whole fucking universe, by the way. It's
not that hard. Nothing is. It just takes some time to learn. Start
at the beginning and build up the knowledge.

You want to know how to build rockets? Do it. Like, for real. The
knowledge to do so is free. What else are you working on that's so
important that you can't crack a book in the bathroom for a few
minutes while you do your business?

Learn new skills, level up, take on new quests, be heroes.

Banshee
September 23rd, 2019
----------------------------------------

I have an idea for a thing. 

Now, I get a lot of ideas for things and some of them are just too
big for me to do in a reasonable timeframe. Sometimes they're so
big my eyes glaze over at the very thought, so I just tell
everyone else in a blog or phlog and hope someone else does it.
Sometimes the idea is so dumb that I know I'm the only hope and
have to do it myself. Sometimes the timinging is such that it
needs to be done right away or it's not relevant. Sometimes time
doesn't matter and I can just ignore it until I'm bored one night.
In my head this all adds up to a sort of Eisenhower decision
matrix:

                        URGENT               NOT URGENT

Well, now I've got an idea for  +-----------------------------+
a project that is too big for   | One of the reasons (not the |

But I never said what this is   | getting there.              |
all about, did I?               +-----------------------------+

So what is it?

I want to make an easily deployable system that creates a platform
for publishing text which does so on web, gopher, gemini, and any
other logical systems, is made available on tor, IPFS, zero-web,
and so on (RSS, fediverse?, moar). Basically, I want you to be
able to click "go" and spin up a server that will push your
text-based content out into the wild on all possible channels at
maximum volume. (Hence why this phost is called Banshee)

Why?

Some people have a hard time getting their voice out from behind
firewalls, oppressive regimes, and so on. I want to make it easy
for them to toss something on a raspberry pi, or spin up a virtual
machine, or SOMETHING, and have a way to be heard.

How?

I really don't know. I assume I could look into containers as
a start. There's a heavy devops part of this that's not my
wheel-house. Frankly, I think I'll need help.

I'm going to start up a tildegit org for this, stub out a repo
with a readme and get some conversations going. I think this could
really help people with real problems today. Hopefully it won't
fall off my radar and into the "someday" category.

  <title>Av 98 Gopher Proxy On Gopher Black</title>

AV-98 gopher proxy on gopher.black
September 21st, 2019
----------------------------------------

Solderpunk had a great response to my VF-1 & AV-98 musings that
you can read here [0].

[0] solderpunk - vf1 av98 and agena
    gopher://zaibatsu.circumlunar.space/0/~solderpunk/phlog/vf1-av98-and-agena.txt

In it he shares the secret of an awesome little project, agena,
that is a gopher to gemini proxy. AV-98 is already capable of
using it out of the box, you just need a proxy to point to.

Well, gopher.black is happy to be your Huckleberry. If you use
AV-98 you can try it out now.

    AV-98> set gopher_proxy gopher.black:1965

That's it. I think you can set that in a config file too, if I'm
not mistaken. Then, if you browse past the limits of gemspace and
hit gopher your adventures will just keep going.

I may add this to tilde.black on a different port (since 1965 is
already in use for that server's gemini pages). If you are extra,
ridiculously paranoid you could then torify your AV-98 session and
hit the tilde.black proxy over tor. You're welcome, Mr. Snowden.

Solderpunk has lots of improvements planned for it, so I expect
agena to grow up real fast.

EDIT:

I'm now running agena on tilde.black on port 1966 as well.

Instead I think I'll say something about compassion.

Right now people are suffering. Richard Stallman is watching in
shock, outrage, and yes, in pain, as the world he built around
himself falls apart. He is suffering.

Also, the dozens of individuals he has interacted with over the
years who have been the targets of his well-meaning pedantry, of
his priviliged musings, and of his "hot takes", are feeling the
painful effects of those encounters. They feel demeaned,
less-than, or ignored. They feel injured, helpless, outraged, and
yes, in pain. They are suffering.

Epstein's victims have suffered horrendously and suffer still as
the government closes their options for compensation in the wake
of his suicide.

In short, there's a whole lot of pain going around and we'd all be
a little bit better people if we took a moment to consider it
before we launch into our next diatribe. That's not to say you
should shut up. Just try not to forget there's humans on the other
side of your outrage.

av-98 and vf-1 daydream
September 18th, 2019
----------------------------------------

This is mostly directed at solderpunk.

I was thinking on AV-98 and VF-1 and how they're so wonderfully
similar. It would be so neat to have a single client that could
browse gopher & gemini protocols seemlessly, and they're kinda the
perfect place to start that thought.

But then I was thinking, "Oh, it would be terrible to start your
journey thinking you're on Gemini and safely using TLS only to
move into Gopher without realizing it and be unprotected." But if
there was a way to differentiate between the modes, sort of like
"battle mode" that visually indicated you were TLS protected, then
things would be better.

I thought about the way I've got my vim status bar configured to
change color when I'm in insert vs normal modes and thought about
that in VF1. One color for "secure" one color for "unsecure".
That'd be neat, right? And what about onion addresses? VF-1 works
quite well over tor, and onion addresses provide end-to-end
encryption. So they could be safely grouped in the "secure" block,
or maybe get a third color.

And that's great for knowing where you are, but not where you're
going. Colorizing links with matching colors would help indicate
your options.

But then again, not everybody like colors, so maybe a prefix on
links or the bar like an "@" or a "!" or something? Or maybe
that's a configuration option.

Anyway, it's a whole bunch of thoughts about somebody elses code
and clients and not my place at all to direct, but I thought I'd
share my thinking in case it inspires anything in you.

Cheers!
