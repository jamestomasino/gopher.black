Port 70 -or- 1436CON
April 12th, 2018

sysdharma posted [0], I replied [1], and sysdharma posted [2]
again about a real gopher convention. Go catch up if you haven't
read those yet. I'll wait...

[2] sysdharma - On a Gopher conference
    gopher://sdf.org/1/users/sysdharma/phlog/./2018.04.12

Here's the thing. I want to do it.

Obviously it's not going to be in-person, but a virtual conference
is totally doable. Here's what I'm thinking:

  - A 24 hour conference
  - Everyone can submit a proposal for a session they want to run
    with the following info:

    - Who you are (handle)
    - Title / Subject of talk
    - Duration
    - Preferred time-slot in UTC
    - Medium of talk (video stream, audio stream, etc)
    - Where will you be watching for feedback/discussion (IRC,
      Social Media, raw TCP packets?)

    We will need a place where these can be submitted and stored.
    It would be great if the submissions could be done in Gopher
    itself (anyone want to volunteer to write a cgi for
    submissions?).
  
  - After X number of days/weeks, we close submissions and print
    up a schedule for everyone to review
  - On the day of the event, it's up to the speakers to get
    themselves online in their medium. (Maybe we can get a 24hr
    anonradio takeover?)
  - Folks can tune in and join the relevant chats
  - Archive the shit out of all of it and host it EVERYWHERE

I also think we should do one or two "special" sessions and close
off the time blocks so they're not up against anyone else.
Round-table or panel discussions would be cool for this. I welcome
ideas.

Finally, I think a hackathon would be cool to toss in the mix. It
could be done the day of, or the day before and results shared out
on the day. I'm not sure what we could gather in prizes, but for
our retro-con I bet we could get a couple minor sponsors willing
to toss in some swag. I'd be amazed if smj didn't jump at the
opportunity to offload some old SDF stickers. ;)

Like the panel discussion, the focus of the hackathon would be
something great to debate. My first suggestion: "Gopher meets
Docker". What sorts of amazingly cool configurations could we bust
out for the community in easy-to-deploy ways? TLS? TOR? Whatever
you can dream up. We could vote on the winners on GopherPoll or
something.

Speaking of GopherPoll (thanks tfurrows for pointing it out),
I'd like to offer one up right away and get your feedback:

[3] What should we name this gopher convention?

tfurrows recently wrote [0] about about the American need for more
space, more square footage, and generally bigger and better
things. You might harken it back to the "go West" mentality and an
assumption born from multi-generational standard-of-living growth,
but I have no real clue where it comes from. And tfurrows is
absolutely right when he says you get looked at funny for defying
that pattern.

[0] tfurrows - square feet
    gopher://circumlunar.space/0/~tfurrows/phlog/akr_squareFeet.txt

My dad certainly doesn't understand my desire to simplify,
downsize (right-size?), and work less. It's really frustrating
with him in particular because he worked so hard to achieve more
and earn more his whole life so that he could enjoy it later, but
he was diagnosed with a death sentence nearly the day after he
retired. How can that not wake you up to the here and now and say,
"use it while you've got it"?

I want a smaller house. Much smaller. This is my first home and
I got it for a ridiculous price because the housing market had
tanked two years before and the owner had been dropping his
selling price ever since. It's now worth double what I paid and
I can't wait to sell it. It's fantastic to have a bunch of space,
but we just fill it with things we don't have time to use. More BS
filling it up is no help to anyone. It's also a huge burden on us
maintaining it and paying utilities. I don't need to work harder
and longer to pay for things I'm not using.

Once we go to Iceland I plan on renting again (if their rental
situation gets cleared up, that is) and eventually working up to
a small home. I don't want any more space than I need. If that
means I have to go outside more, even better! Lowering my
cost-of-living means I can enjoy the same options or more and
still lower my workload. I'm not going to be able to match my
current salary in Iceland anyway, so it all aligns. Work less,
live smaller, enjoy things today instead of putting them off for
later.

Re: sysdharma - Gophercon
April 08th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I was so excited about the possibility of a gophercon when I saw
the first mention of Brazil. I was just as heartbroken when it
turned out (once again) to be about Go-lang. It drives me crazy
that they keep using "gopher" for everything. Fakes me out every
time. Boo.

Bitreich has something they do in Germany for gopher, but I'm not
sure what sort of attendance it gets or if it's more for their
private community. I'd love a real gopher (1436) conference, but
we regular users are far too spread out around the globe. I can't
imagine many people traveling across continents to attend. Maybe
a virtual thing? Do those work?

If we were to have a conference I think it should either be called
simply "1436con" or "Port 70". No confusion there. What sort of
things would happen at a conference for gopher? Ideas:

  - A talk or two on TLS and Gopher over Tor 
  - Panel discussion on the pros & cons of adding new ItemTypes
  - "To gophermap or not to gophermap, that is the question"
  - Social networking on legacy, minimal systems
  - Other sociological stuff about community
  - "Content is King"

What else?

Interactive Fiction
April 08th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I've been thinking about writing some interactive fiction, or at
least a choose-your-own-adventure story. I want to do it on gopher
using gophermaps, keeping it as simple as links at the end of each
section. Any suggestions for a subject, theme, genre? I don't want
to tackle anything too long since I'll have to write all the
different variations.

Have any of you done one of these before? I was going to plot it
out on notecards first and write the scenes from there. Is there
a better way?

Cyberspace
April 08th, 2018
----------------------------------------

A few minutes ago in the #gopher irc room on sdf.org, zcrayfish
just mentioned remembering connecting to sdf over old modem
programs (xyzmodem). It brought back a flood of memories. I last
remember using zmodem to connect to my friend Kris's new machine.
We connected via blank term sometimes and just typed messages back
and forth in the same buffer. When we switched to zmodem I can
remember the thrill the first time we successfully resumed a file
transfer, not having to start it all over. Brilliant.

Mostly what stood out to me in memory is that the setting of these
memories was virtual. I did not remember sitting at my computer
using zmodem, but as if my place in the world was within zmodem.
I embodied it to the fullest extent of existential awareness.
I had no body, only idea form.

That makes me think more broadly on that concept. I did not have
it before that time when connecting to Prodigy and spending time
on the Xanth Chatroom I would eventually moderate. Those memories
involve seeing my hands typing, and the texture of the monitor.
I wasn't "in" the computer then. Ahh, but later, connecting to
Snakes Lair BBS in South Jersey, I am there in the door games, in
the discussion boards, in all of it.

BBSes are the start of virtual existance for me. That feels pretty
cool.

Fat
April 07th, 2018
----------------------------------------

I keep track of my weight and a bunch of other measurements with
a little shell function that logs to a csv file on dropbox. A year
ago I made some fantastic progress but then it all fell apart.
With the new year I started getting back into my good habits and
once again was making progress. Last month I got really sick: flu,
pneumonia, blah blah. I fell off the wagon (a food wagon) and have
been eating like crap once again.

Tomorrow it's back on diet again (keto) and I know I'll feel so
much better soon. To help prep me mentally I decided to plot my
weight progress.

I've stripped off the axis info here cause you don't need to see
all that, but you can see from the shape of the data that it's
been a wild ride. I hope things go more smoothly this time. I'm
sick of being fat.

Side note: I generated that chart with an awesome command-line

cleanup) can be found here [1].

The final command to generate that chart:

  awk -F "," '{print $1 "-" $2 "-" $3 "," $4}' weight.csv | \

Bob Alberti [0] is now on SDF and has started a Phlog [1]. You

The Bible
April 05th, 2018
----------------------------------------

Yesterday I added a new section to my gopher hole [0]. It's the
English Standard Version of the Bible, used with permission. I've
written a script to fetch books/chapters/verses on demand and used
it to prepopulate a full view of the Bible, chapter by chapter.
I'm pretty sure everything came in properly, but I'll be double
checking over the coming weeks.

My next step is to add some safeguards to the script and make it
work on demand as a cgi. There are limitations on how much can be
queried at once and such attached to the API, so I'll need to plan
accordingly. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, pop on over and give it a read. It's my favorite
translation: a literal one with modern grammar. I've opted to
suppress chapter & verse markings as well as footnotes and just
let the text live on its own. I think it makes things much more
reabable.
